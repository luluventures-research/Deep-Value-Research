# **Understanding the Balance Sheet – Assets, Liabilities, and Equity**

A **balance sheet** is a financial statement that shows what a company owns, what it owes, and the amount invested by shareholders at a specific point in time . It provides a *snapshot* of a company’s financial position by listing its **assets**, **liabilities**, and **shareholders’ equity**, adhering to the fundamental accounting equation: **Assets \= Liabilities \+ Shareholders’ Equity** . Along with the income statement and cash flow statement, the balance sheet is one of the three core financial statements used to evaluate a business’s health . By examining the balance sheet, investors and analysts can assess a company’s liquidity, leverage, and overall financial strength .

**Assets:** Assets represent everything the company owns or controls that has economic value. They are categorized into **current assets** (which can be converted to cash within one year) and **non-current assets** (held for longer than one year) . Current assets typically include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable (money owed by customers), inventory, and other resources expected to be liquidated or used in the near term . Non-current assets (also called long-term assets) include long-lived items such as property, plant, and equipment (PP\&E), long-term investments, intangible assets (e.g. patents, goodwill), and other assets that are not intended for sale in the next year . These assets are critical for a company’s operations and growth – for example, PP\&E represents factories or equipment used to produce goods, while intangible assets might include trademarks or research & development investments.

**Liabilities:** Liabilities are the obligations and debts the company owes to outside parties. Similar to assets, liabilities are divided into **current liabilities** (obligations due within one year) and **non-current liabilities** (due after more than one year) . Current liabilities typically include short-term debt (such as commercial paper or current portions of long-term loans), accounts payable (money owed to suppliers), accrued expenses (incurred costs like wages or taxes that are owed but not yet paid), and other payables due in the short term. Non-current liabilities include longer-term obligations such as long-term loans and bonds payable, deferred tax liabilities, lease obligations, or other long-term commitments . These represent claims against the company’s assets; for instance, a bank loan is a liability that must be repaid over time. Managing liabilities is important – a company must ensure it can meet its short-term liabilities as they come due (liquidity management) and maintain a reasonable level of long-term debt (solvency management).

**Shareholders’ Equity:** Shareholders’ equity (often just called **equity** or **owners’ equity**) represents the owners’ residual interest in the assets after all liabilities are paid. In other words, Equity \= Assets – Liabilities . Equity comprises several components, commonly including **share capital** (the funds raised from issuing stock) and **retained earnings** (the cumulative profits that have been reinvested in the business rather than paid out as dividends). It may also include other comprehensive income and treasury stock adjustments. Essentially, equity is the net value “left over” for shareholders if the company sold all its assets and paid off all its liabilities. A high equity balance generally indicates that a company has built up assets through profitable operations (retained earnings) or investor contributions, whereas a lower or negative equity could signal that liabilities exceed assets (potential solvency issues).

*Illustration of a basic balance sheet structure: **Total Assets** are balanced by **Total Liabilities** plus **Total Shareholders’ Equity**. Assets are split into current and non-current sections on the left, while liabilities (current and non-current) and shareholders’ equity are on the right .*

**Why the Balance Sheet “balances”:** The balance sheet must always satisfy the equation Assets \= Liabilities \+ Equity. This makes intuitive sense – all assets of a company are financed either by borrowing money (liabilities) or by owners’ investments (equity). For example, if a company takes out a $4,000 loan, its cash (asset) increases by $4,000 and simultaneously a loan payable (liability) increases by $4,000, keeping the balance sheet in equilibrium . If the company instead raises $8,000 by issuing stock to investors, cash (asset) goes up $8,000 and shareholders’ equity goes up $8,000 . Every transaction affects this balance. The requirement that the balance sheet balances is fundamental – if Assets do not equal Liabilities \+ Equity, it indicates an error in the accounts or reporting. In practice, companies report their assets in order of liquidity and their liabilities in order of maturity. This means current assets (cash, accounts receivable, etc.) are listed first, followed by non-current assets (equipment, etc.), while current liabilities (due soon) are listed before long-term liabilities . After liabilities, shareholders’ equity is reported. The **book value** of the company is reflected in the equity section – it’s essentially the net worth of the company according to its books.

**Interpreting a Balance Sheet – Liquidity and Leverage:** Simply reading raw asset and liability values is informative, but analysts often derive **financial ratios** from the balance sheet to assess a company’s health. One key metric is the **current ratio**, which is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities . The current ratio measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its short-term resources. For example, a current ratio of 1.0 means current assets equal current liabilities; a value above 1.0 indicates that current assets exceed the liabilities due within one year (generally a good liquidity position), whereas a value below 1.0 could signal potential liquidity risk (the company has more obligations coming due in the short term than readily available assets to cover them) . Another important metric is the **debt-to-equity ratio (D/E)**, which compares a company’s total liabilities (or debt) to its shareholders’ equity . This ratio reveals the extent to which the company is financed by debt versus owned funds. A higher D/E ratio means relatively more debt for each dollar of equity – in other words, the company is more leveraged, which can amplify returns *and* risks. A D/E of 1.0, for instance, means the company’s liabilities equal its equity; a D/E of 2.0 would mean liabilities are twice equity (high leverage), while a low D/E (say 0.3) indicates a more conservative financing structure with modest debt. Lastly, the **equity ratio** (shareholders’ equity divided by total assets) indicates what proportion of assets is funded by owners’ equity. It essentially is the inverse of the debt ratio; for example, an equity ratio of 50% means half of the assets are financed by equity (and, implicitly, the other half by liabilities). A higher equity ratio signifies a stronger capital base and potentially less vulnerability to debt obligations, whereas a low equity ratio (especially under 20–30%) means assets are largely funded by debt. Each industry has different norms for these ratios, so it’s useful to compare a company’s ratios to its peers. Analysts also consider other metrics (like the *acid-test ratio* or *quick ratio*, which is a stricter liquidity test excluding inventory, and various turnover ratios), but the current ratio, debt-to-equity, and equity ratio are fundamental ones that emerge directly from the balance sheet .

**Using the Balance Sheet in Context:** While the balance sheet on its own provides a snapshot at period end, it is most powerful when analyzed over time or in conjunction with the income statement and cash flow statement. Trends in assets and liabilities (for example, a steadily increasing cash reserve, or growing debt levels) can signal changes in a company’s strategy or financial health. For instance, if **inventories** (a current asset) are growing much faster than sales, it might indicate potential overstocking or weakening demand. If **accounts receivable** are growing, it could mean the company is selling more on credit – which boosts sales, but one must watch that receivables don’t become overdue (affecting cash flow). On the liabilities side, a buildup of short-term debt or accounts payable might signal liquidity pressure or deliberate use of credit from suppliers. **Retained earnings** (part of equity) increase each year by the amount of net income kept in the business – so a profitable company will generally show growing equity over time, unless it’s aggressively buying back stock or paying big dividends (both of which reduce equity). In summary, the balance sheet, when “read” alongside other statements, tells a story about the company’s financial strategy: how it is financing operations (debt vs equity), how liquid its position is, and how much cushion it has to absorb future losses or fund growth. In the next section, we will apply these concepts by examining the latest balance sheets of the top 10 S\&P 500 companies and analyzing their key figures and ratios.

## **Top 10 S\&P 500 Companies: Balance Sheet Analysis**

We now turn to a practical analysis of the balance sheets of the top 10 S\&P 500 companies by market capitalization (as of the latest available data). These companies are financial giants – primarily in technology – and include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Nvidia, Meta (Facebook), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, and Eli Lilly. For each company, we will identify their total assets, total liabilities, and total equity (shareholders’ equity) from the most recent balance sheet (latest fiscal year or quarter), highlight major trends or notable features, and evaluate key balance-sheet ratios: **current ratio**, **debt-to-equity ratio**, and **equity ratio**. All figures are in U.S. dollars, and “billion” (B) denotes one thousand million (10^9).

To provide a summary view, the table below compiles these companies’ balance sheet metrics side by side:

| Company | Total Assets(USD, B) | Total Liabilities(USD, B) | Total Equity(USD, B) | Current Ratio(Current A / Current L) | Debt-to-Equity(Total Debt / Equity) | Equity Ratio(Equity / Assets) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Apple (FY 2025\)** | 359.2  | 285.5  | 73.7  | 0.89  | 1.34 (≈134%)  | 20.5%  |

*(Sources: Latest annual reports or quarterly filings for each company, as compiled by S\&P Global/StockAnalysis . “FY” denotes fiscal year-end data; Apple’s fiscal year ended September 2025, Microsoft’s June 2025, and others on December 2024\. Current ratio and debt-to-equity are calculated from those balance sheets; “Total Debt” for debt-to-equity includes interest-bearing short and long-term debt.)*

Let’s discuss each company in turn, noting their balance sheet highlights and what the ratios tell us:

### **Apple Inc. (FY 2025\)**

Apple’s balance sheet (as of September 2025\) shows **total assets of $359.2 billion**, funded by **$285.5 billion in liabilities**and **$73.7 billion in shareholders’ equity** . Notably, Apple’s equity is relatively small for a company of its size – only about 20% of assets are financed by equity (equity ratio \~20.5% ), while the rest (nearly 80%) are financed by liabilities. This is intentional: Apple has for years returned capital to shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends, which reduces equity (retained earnings) even as the company remains highly profitable. **Major trends:** Apple’s assets actually *decreased slightly* from the prior year (down from $365.0B), mainly due to a reduction in its cash and marketable securities . This suggests Apple drew down some of its massive cash reserves – possibly to fund continued stock repurchases or other investments. On the other hand, Apple’s equity **increased** from about $57B to $73.7B year-on-year . This rise in equity despite buybacks reflects Apple’s enormous net income (over $112B in FY2025) outpacing its capital returns . On the liability side, Apple’s total debt (mostly long-term bonds and commercial paper) was about $98.7B, slightly lower than the prior year as the company paid down some debt . **Liquidity:** Apple’s **current ratio** is **0.89** , meaning current assets ($148.0B) are a bit less than current liabilities ($165.6B). A current ratio below 1 is usually a red flag, but in Apple’s case it is common and not alarming. Apple generates strong, steady cash flows and can fund its short-term obligations through ongoing operations (and it has access to financing). Many of Apple’s current liabilities are things like vendor payables and deferred revenue (customer prepayments) – which don’t pose a liquidity crisis given Apple’s cash-generating power. **Leverage:** Apple’s **debt-to-equity ratio** (using interest-bearing debt) is about **1.34** (or 134%) . In other words, Apple’s debt is roughly 1.34 times its equity. This is a fairly high D/E for a cash-rich tech company; it reflects Apple’s strategy of issuing debt (especially when interest rates were low) to fund share buybacks, taking advantage of its high credit rating. If we considered *total* liabilities to equity, Apple’s leverage would be even higher (\~3.87x equity), but those liabilities include many non-debt items. Apple’s balance sheet shows a large **accumulated deficit** in equity (negative retained earnings of $14.3B) – a result of trillions spent on stock repurchases that reduce retained earnings. Despite the low equity, Apple’s financial position remains robust due to its consistent profitability and $54.7B in cash and marketable securities on hand . Overall, Apple’s balance sheet indicates *efficient capital management*– low idle equity, substantial but manageable debt, and ample liquidity through cash and its reputation in credit markets.

### **Microsoft Corp. (FY 2025\)**

Microsoft’s latest balance sheet (June 30, 2025\) is significantly larger after its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in late 2023\. Microsoft reports **$619.0 billion in total assets**, **$275.5 billion in liabilities**, and **$343.5 billion in equity** . A striking feature is Microsoft’s high **equity ratio (\~55%)** – over half of its assets are financed by shareholders’ equity . This implies a comparatively low reliance on debt. Indeed, Microsoft holds a huge base of retained earnings from decades of profitable operations (its equity jumped from $268B to $343B over FY2024-25 largely due to net income retention and the new shares issued for the Activision acquisition) . **Asset trends:** Microsoft’s assets grew dramatically, up from $512B a year earlier to $619B . Two major drivers stand out: *Goodwill* and *intangibles* swelled to $119.5B and $21.2B respectively , reflecting the Activision acquisition (goodwill arises when a company is acquired for more than the fair value of its net assets). Additionally, Microsoft is investing heavily in data centers and cloud infrastructure – its property, plant & equipment (PP\&E) grew to $154.6B in FY2024 and further to $229.8B by Sep 2025 , an enormous increase (this includes servers and hardware to support Azure and AI services). On the **liability** side, Microsoft’s debt is relatively modest. It has about $43.2B in long-term and current debt combined on its books , and total liabilities of $275.5B include large deferred revenues and customer prepayments for software services. Microsoft’s **current ratio** is **\~1.35** , indicating solid liquidity – it has $189.1B of current assets (including a cash/investments war chest of $102B) against $135.0B of current liabilities . This healthy current ratio means Microsoft can comfortably meet short-term obligations. Its **debt-to-equity ratio** (interest-bearing debt to equity) is only about **0.13** (13%) , reflecting very low leverage. Even including *all*liabilities, Microsoft’s liabilities-to-equity is \~0.80, which is still conservative. Microsoft’s balance sheet strength – large equity cushion, lots of cash, limited debt – gives it tremendous financial flexibility. This conservative profile is partly why Microsoft carries a high credit rating. In summary, Microsoft appears *under-leveraged* relative to its capacity; it chooses to maintain a strong balance sheet, likely to preserve flexibility for strategic investments (like major acquisitions) and to weather any downturns in its business.

### **Alphabet Inc. (Google) (FY 2024\)**

Alphabet’s balance sheet (Dec 31, 2024\) reflects its status as a cash-rich tech giant with minimal debt. Alphabet (Google’s parent company) reported **$450.3 billion in assets**, **$125.2 billion in liabilities**, and **$325.1 billion in equity** . The **equity ratio is about 72%**, extremely high – nearly three quarters of Alphabet’s assets are funded by equity . Correspondingly, its **debt-to-equity ratio is very low (\~0.04)** . Alphabet carries only about $12–13B in long-term debt (and a small current portion) on a base of $325B equity, which is almost negligible debt. In fact, Alphabet’s *total* liabilities (including all payables and accruals) amount to only \~38% of assets – an exceptionally strong balance sheet structure. **Trends and components:** Alphabet’s assets have been growing steadily (up from $402B at 2023’s end to $450B at 2024’s end) . A significant portion of this growth is in *long-term investments and marketable securities* – Alphabet invests its excess cash heavily. By the end of 2024, it held about $95.7B in cash and short-term securities and an additional $40.9B in long-term marketable investments . Another major asset line is *Property, Plant & Equipment*, at $184.6B , which includes Google’s extensive network of data centers, servers, and offices. This grew substantially (it was $148B at 2023\) as Alphabet continues capital expenditures for its cloud services and infrastructure. Alphabet’s **current ratio** stands around **1.84** – very comfortable liquidity. It had $163.7B of current assets vs $89.1B of current liabilities at FY 2024 . Its current assets include not only cash but also large accounts receivable (over $52B, mostly from advertising customers) . On the liability side, Alphabet’s current liabilities ($89B) consist of things like accounts payable, accrued expenses (e.g. unpaid costs, salaries), and accrued revenue-sharing with partners . Alphabet’s long-term liabilities ($36B of the $125B total) are relatively small and include deferred tax liabilities and lease obligations – its long-term debt was only \~$10.9B in 2024 . **Overall**, Alphabet’s balance sheet is very conservative. The company has **immense financial firepower**: net cash (cash minus debt) well over $80B and low leverage. This insulates Alphabet in economic downturns and gives it capacity for big investments (in R\&D, AI, etc.) or acquisitions. The high equity also reflects Alphabet’s profitability – retained earnings have accumulated significantly (over $200B of retained profits are part of that $325B equity). Alphabet’s strong balance sheet ratios (low D/E, high current ratio) suggest *excellent solvency and liquidity*. Investors often view Alphabet as having “fortress-like” financials, meaning it can withstand shocks and fund innovations internally.

### **Amazon.com Inc. (FY 2024\)**

Amazon’s balance sheet (Dec 31, 2024\) illustrates its heavy investment in fulfillment infrastructure and its recent return to profitability. Amazon showed **$624.9 billion in assets**, **$338.9 billion in liabilities**, and **$286.0 billion in equity** at year-end 2024 . This equity was significantly higher than the prior year (2023 equity was $201.9B ), indicating Amazon’s strong 2024 earnings (after a relatively weaker 2022). **Asset composition and trends:** Amazon’s single largest asset line is *Property, Plant & Equipment*, reflecting its warehouses, data centers (for AWS), and transportation equipment. PP\&E reached $328.8B in 2024 , up sharply from $276.7B in 2023\. By Q3 2025 it was even higher at $407.9B – Amazon has been investing aggressively in capacity and technology infrastructure. Amazon’s *current assets* of $190.9B include a substantial cash and short-term investments position ($101.2B at 2024\) and a large inventory ($34.2B) and accounts receivable ($48.9B) as of 2024 . **Liquidity:** Amazon’s **current ratio** is about **1.06** (at FY 2024), which is just above 1\. This is much improved from 2022 when current liabilities were larger than current assets. In 2024, Amazon had $190.9B in current assets versus $179.4B in current liabilities , so it has a small short-term cushion. Notably, Amazon’s business model brings substantial current liabilities: at 2024, *accounts payable* alone were $94.4B , arising from its retail operations (money owed to suppliers). Amazon also had $42.8B in accrued expenses and other current liabilities , including salaries and fulfillment costs. These liabilities are largely offset by Amazon’s cash on hand and the fact that Amazon collects cash from customers quickly (often before paying suppliers – a positive working capital cycle). **Leverage:** Amazon’s **debt-to-equity ratio** is around **0.23** (23%) . Amazon carries about $65–70B in long-term debt (mostly corporate bonds) and a few billion in current debt – together roughly $65B at FY 2024 . With $286B equity, the D/E is moderate. Including all liabilities, Amazon’s total liabilities are 1.19 times its equity (338.9/286.0), meaning assets are roughly half financed by equity, half by liabilities – a balanced structure. The equity jump in 2024 (from $146B in 2021 to $286B in 2024\) was due to robust profits in AWS and a rebound from prior losses and accounting adjustments (Amazon had a large loss in 2022 due to Rivian investment markdowns, which had temporarily depressed equity). Amazon’s balance sheet also contains a sizable **goodwill** ($23.1B) from past acquisitions and **long-term leases** (as liabilities) for warehouses, which are not in the debt figure but are obligations. **Overall assessment:** Amazon’s balance sheet is *asset-heavy*, especially compared to other tech firms – its billions in physical assets reflect its hybrid retail and cloud model. The **current ratio** just above 1 indicates Amazon tightly manages working capital, relying on efficient cash conversion cycles. The **debt-to-equity** is relatively low; Amazon has room to borrow if needed, but it has historically financed expansion mostly through operating cash flow. In 2024, rising equity and manageable debt signaled a healthier capital structure than a couple of years prior. Investors watch Amazon’s cash versus debt closely, as the company’s massive expansion plans require continuous capital – by 2025, Amazon built back a large cash reserve ($67B cash in Sep 2025\) while keeping leverage in check. In summary, Amazon’s balance sheet reflects *aggressive growth investments*balanced by improving profitability and prudent liquidity management.

### **Nvidia Corp. (FY 2025\)**

Nvidia’s balance sheet (Jan 29, 2024, which is FY 2025 for Nvidia) and recent quarter (Oct 2025\) highlight the explosion in its size due to the AI boom. As of the FY2025 annual report, **Nvidia had $65.7 billion in assets**, **$22.8 billion in liabilities**, and **$43.0 billion in equity** . However, by late 2025 (Q3 of FY2026), Nvidia’s assets had **soared to $161.1 billion** and equity to **$118.9 billion** – roughly **doubling** within a year, thanks to unprecedented revenues and profits in 2024–2025. **Key features:** Nvidia’s balance sheet is extremely liquid and low-leverage. At FY2025, Nvidia held $25.98B in cash and short-term investments (and this nearly *tripled* by Oct 2025 to $60.6B , as the company amassed cash from surging sales of AI chips). Its current assets far exceed current liabilities – **current ratio was 4.44** at FY2025 (and similarly high in recent quarters) . For example, at Jan 2024 Nvidia had $44.3B of current assets vs only $10.6B of current liabilities . This **current ratio \~4.4** is very high, reflecting that Nvidia has no liquidity concerns whatsoever; it’s sitting on a large cash pile relative to short-term needs. **Leverage:** Nvidia’s **debt-to-equity ratio** is about **0.11 (11%)** . It has only around $8.5B in total debt (mostly long-term $8.46B and a small current portion) , against $79.3B equity (FY2025). As profits were retained through 2025, equity jumped, making D/E even smaller by late 2025 (\~$7.5B debt vs $118.9B equity, \~0.06). Nvidia’s liabilities consist largely of accounts payable and accrued expenses ($6.3B AP at FY2025) and deferred revenue, which are tiny relative to assets. With an **equity ratio around 71%** (FY2025), Nvidia’s assets are predominantly funded by shareholder funds. **Trends:** The most notable trend is Nvidia’s *asset growth.*Inventory rose (from $5.3B to $10.1B in FY2025) as the company ramped up production of GPUs to meet demand . Accounts receivable also spiked (from $10.0B to $23.1B) reflecting huge late-2023 sales that hadn’t been collected by year-end . Simultaneously, Nvidia’s retained earnings swelled its equity – net income in the first three quarters of 2025 alone was very large, contributing to equity growth. Nvidia’s PP\&E is relatively modest ($8.1B in FY2025) since it outsources chip fabrication, but this too is growing with investments in packaging and facilities . **Overall:** Nvidia’s balance sheet is **extremely strong**. It is in a net cash position (cash far exceeds debt) and has minimal leverage. The **current ratio \~4.4** indicates it could pay its short-term liabilities more than four times over – a sign of *excess liquidity*. Management might deploy some of this cash for share buybacks (Nvidia has done buybacks in the past) or acquisitions. With such low debt, Nvidia’s **debt-to-equity of \~0.1** means nearly all growth has been funded by equity and retained profits. This conservative financial position gives Nvidia resilience if the cyclical semiconductor market turns down – it has plenty of buffer. In summary, Nvidia’s balance sheet mirrors its recent success: assets (and equity) skyrocketing from profitability, and very little reliance on borrowing.

### **Meta Platforms Inc. (Facebook) (FY 2024\)**

Meta’s balance sheet (Dec 31, 2024\) reflects heavy capital expenditures in the “metaverse” and AI, alongside a return to robust profit growth after the 2022 slump. Meta reported **$276.1 billion in assets**, **$93.4 billion in liabilities**, and **$182.6 billion in equity** at the end of 2024 . Meta’s **equity ratio is \~66%** – like Alphabet, it’s financed mostly by equity, with a light debt load . **Key changes and composition:** One of the most striking items on Meta’s balance sheet is its *Property, Plant & Equipment*, which reached $136.3B in 2024 (up from $109.9B in 2023\) and further to $177.6B by Q3 2025 . This surge is due to Meta’s massive investments in data centers and infrastructure for both its core social media business and future AR/VR (“metaverse”) ambitions. In fact, PP\&E now constitutes the largest portion of Meta’s assets, surpassing even its cash holdings. Meta’s *current assets* were $100.0B at 2024, including $77.8B in cash and short-term investments . Interestingly, by Q3 2025, Meta’s cash had dropped to around $44.4B – the company spent a lot on share buybacks and capex in 2025, reducing its cash pile. **Liquidity:** Meta’s **current ratio** was a strong **2.98** at FY 2024 (current assets $100.0B vs current liabilities $33.6B). By late 2025 it was still about 2.0+. This means Meta has nearly 3 times the short-term assets needed to cover its short-term obligations – a very comfortable liquidity position. Its current liabilities ($33.6B) include things like accrued expenses and accounts payable; notably, Meta had large accruals for costs (e.g., content moderation, AR/VR project expenses) and also an income tax payable of $3.65B at 2024 . None of these short-term liabilities pose an issue given Meta’s cash and receivables ($17.0B in accounts receivable at 2024, mostly from advertisers) . **Leverage:** Meta’s **debt-to-equity ratio** is about **0.16** (16%) . Meta historically had *no* long-term debt until 2022, when it issued bonds. By 2024, Meta’s long-term debt was $28.8B – still small relative to its $182.6B equity. Meta’s total liabilities of $93.4B are mostly comprised of things like accounts payable, accrued expenses, lease liabilities for offices, and deferred tax liabilities, in addition to that $28.8B of debt. With an equity base of $182.6B (up from $153.2B in 2023 thanks to 2024’s healthy profits), Meta’s balance sheet leverage is quite low. **Trends:** Meta’s equity grew in 2024 despite huge share buybacks (it repurchased billions in stock, which reduces equity), because it earned over $30B net income. However, in 2025, Meta’s aggressive buybacks continued, which is evident in the drop in cash. The increase in *goodwill* to $20.7B in 2024 hints that Meta made some acquisitions (though relatively small, as goodwill rose only marginally from $20.3B). The combination of high spending on hardware (reflected in PP\&E) and returning cash to shareholders is leading Meta to dip into its cash reserves – but it remains in a solid position. **Overall:** Meta’s balance sheet is strong, though not quite as liquid as Alphabet’s. A **current ratio near 3** and **equity financing \~66% of assets**indicate low financial risk. The **debt-to-equity at 0.16** is easily manageable – interest costs are a small fraction of earnings. Investors are mostly focused on how Meta’s heavy capital investments (which balloon the asset base) will translate into future earnings. The balance sheet shows Meta can afford this spending: it has plenty of equity cushion and still tens of billions in liquidity to weather any challenges in monetizing its metaverse or AI initiatives. In sum, Meta’s financial position is **sound and largely unlevered**, giving it capacity to continue investing and returning capital to shareholders simultaneously.

### **Tesla Inc. (FY 2024\)**

Tesla’s balance sheet (Dec 31, 2024\) reflects its rapid growth in production capacity and improving financial stability compared to earlier years. At year-end 2024, Tesla had **$122.1 billion in assets**, **$48.4 billion in liabilities**, and **$73.7 billion in equity** . Notably, 2024 was the first time Tesla’s equity (built from cumulative profits since 2020\) overtook its liabilities – equity financing \~60% of assets, liabilities \~40% . This is a stark change from Tesla’s earlier days when it had more debt and negative retained earnings. **Asset mix and trends:** Tesla’s assets are dominated by *Property, Plant & Equipment*, which was $51.5B in 2024 (factories like Gigafactories in Nevada, Shanghai, Berlin, Texas, etc.) . This grew from $45.1B in 2023 and continues to grow as Tesla builds new factories and expands existing ones. Tesla’s *current assets* were $58.4B, including $36.6B of cash & short-term investments and $12.0B of inventory . Inventory declined slightly from 2023 ($13.6B) to 2024 ($12.0B) , indicating Tesla managed to deliver cars efficiently despite ramping production (perhaps aided by year-end sales pushes and price cuts to clear inventory). **Liquidity:** Tesla’s **current ratio**was **2.03** at FY 2024 , meaning it had roughly double the current assets to cover current liabilities. This is a robust liquidity position. Its current liabilities ($28.8B) include things like accounts payable ($12.5B) for parts and equipment, accrued liabilities ($3.8B) for expenses, and customer deposits for cars (recorded as deferred revenue) – Tesla collects order deposits and payments often before delivery. Tesla’s cash on hand ($36.6B in cash/investments) comfortably exceeds its short-term obligations, a far cry from a decade ago when Tesla lived quarter-to-quarter. **Leverage:** Tesla’s **debt-to-equity ratio** is about **0.11** . Tesla has dramatically reduced its reliance on debt. As of 2024, it had only \~$5.5B in long-term debt (down from \>$10B in 2017\) and about $2.3B in current portion of debt , totaling \~$7.9B. With $73.7B equity, that yields the 0.11 D/E. In fact, Tesla’s cash ($36B) far exceeds its total debt, making it net cash positive. Tesla’s total liabilities ($48.4B) do include a sizable chunk of *customer deposits and deferred revenue* for products like its Full Self-Driving software (which is paid upfront and recognized over time). These are effectively interest-free loans from customers, but not traditional debt. Tesla’s equity has grown explosively from just $5.8B in 2018 to $73.7B in 2024 , thanks to consecutive profitable years and a large $10B stock issuance in 2020\. **Overall:** Tesla’s balance sheet is in its strongest shape ever. The **equity ratio \~60%** indicates more than half of assets funded by equity – a healthy sign for what was once a highly leveraged startup. The **current ratio \~2.0** shows adequate short-term liquidity; Tesla shouldn’t face cash crunches for routine operations (it even paid down debt early in some cases). The **debt-to-equity** being only 0.11 underscores Tesla’s low financial leverage – most of its growth has been funded through equity (both retained earnings and past stock raises) rather than borrowing. This low leverage, combined with a cash buffer, means Tesla is better positioned to invest in new models and factories without jeopardizing financial stability. From a risk perspective, Tesla’s balance sheet has shifted it into a more mature, self-sustaining phase: it likely won’t need to raise capital to survive, as it did in earlier years, and can instead fund expansion largely from internal resources.

### **Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (FY 2024\)**

Berkshire Hathaway’s balance sheet is an outlier among this group because Berkshire is a conglomerate spanning insurance, utilities, manufacturing, and more. As of Dec 31, 2024, **Berkshire had $1.154 trillion in total assets** and **$502.2 billion in liabilities**, with **$651.7 billion in shareholders’ equity** . This enormous balance sheet is primarily due to its insurance businesses (GEICO, Berkshire Reinsurance, etc.), which hold large investment portfolios. A key thing to note is that **Berkshire’s current ratio and debt-to-equity metrics are not very meaningful in the traditional sense**, because of insurance accounting: *Insurance float* (premiums received but not yet paid out as claims) shows up as current liabilities, but it’s a revolving source of funding for Berkshire. That said, we can observe that Berkshire’s **equity ratio is \~56.5%** – over half its assets are funded by equity, which is strong. Its **liabilities-to-equity** is around 0.77, and much of those liabilities are insurance reserves rather than debt. **Composition:** The asset side of Berkshire’s balance sheet includes a massive stock portfolio (Apple, Bank of America, etc.) and cash. By end of 2024, Berkshire’s *cash and short-term securities* were $334.2B – Buffett is famous for holding a large cash buffer. It also holds *long-term investments* of $318.1B (equities and bonds) . Together, these investments make up roughly half of Berkshire’s assets. The other half includes the operating companies’ assets: e.g., BNSF Railway’s trains and tracks, Berkshire Energy’s utilities and infrastructure, manufacturing subsidiaries’ plants, etc. For example, *Property, Plant & Equipment* was $228.8B at 2024 . **Liabilities:** Berkshire’s insurance float (unearned premiums and loss reserves) sits in current liabilities and long-term liabilities. Total insurance-related liabilities were on the order of hundreds of billions. Berkshire also has borrowings in its railroad and utility businesses, but overall its **debt-to-equity is quite low**. For instance, at 2024, Berkshire’s notes and other borrowings (excluding railroad/utility debt) were modest relative to equity. The conglomerate’s **current liabilities**($407.4B at 2024 for the insurance/other segments) roughly match its current assets ($407.4B) , yielding a current ratio about 1.0. But this is not a sign of weakness – it’s just the nature of insurance float (they have high current liabilities for potential claims, but corresponding high current asset investments). **Trends:** Berkshire’s assets and equity jumped significantly from 2023 to 2024 – equity grew from $570.8B to $651.7B . This was largely due to *investment gains* and earnings. 2024 saw a stock market increase, boosting the value of Berkshire’s equity holdings (which flow through comprehensive income to equity). For example, Berkshire’s stake in Apple appreciated substantially in 2024, contributing to a higher equity. Also, Berkshire’s own operating earnings added to retained earnings. The **liabilities** grew too (from $499.2B to $502.2B) , but much slower than assets, reflecting disciplined underwriting in insurance – float didn’t grow as fast as investments. **Overall:** Berkshire Hathaway’s balance sheet is **extremely solid**. Its **debt levels are low relative to equity** – the company could pay off all its liabilities and still have over $150B in net assets to spare, theoretically. The conglomerate structure means Berkshire is not as focused on ratios like current ratio, but rather on ensuring *insurance liabilities are matched with sufficient assets*. With over $381.7B in cash and short-term investments on hand by Q3 2025 , Berkshire has huge liquidity. It uses this liquidity opportunistically for investments and acquisitions. Berkshire’s **book value per share** (shareholders’ equity per share) keeps rising and is a metric many shareholders follow – in 2024 book value was up \~14% year-over-year, reflecting the strong balance sheet growth. In summary, Berkshire’s financial position is *conservative*: plenty of equity, a mountain of high-quality invested assets, and manageable debt. It’s built to withstand catastrophes in insurance or downturns in the economy, which is evident from its hefty equity buffer and cash.

### **Broadcom Inc. (FY 2024\)**

Broadcom’s balance sheet (Nov 3, 2024 – end of its FY2024) underwent a big transformation due to its acquisition of VMware in 2024\. Broadcom recorded **$165.6 billion in total assets**, **$98.0 billion in liabilities**, and **$67.7 billion in equity** at FY2024 close . Prior to the VMware deal, Broadcom’s assets were about $72.9B in 2023, so they more than doubled after the acquisition . **Impact of acquisition:** The VMware takeover added significant *goodwill* and *intangible assets* to Broadcom’s balance sheet. Goodwill jumped to $97.9B in 2024 from $43.7B in 2023 , and intangible assets (like software patents, customer relationships) rose to $40.6B from $3.87B . This indicates Broadcom paid a premium over VMware’s tangible asset value, creating goodwill. The acquisition was financed by a mix of cash and stock: Broadcom issued new shares (boosting equity) and took on debt. We see **equity surged** from $24.0B in 2023 to $67.7B in 2024 , partly because Broadcom’s shareholders’ equity now includes new shares given to VMware’s shareholders (and retained earnings from Broadcom’s profits). **Liabilities** also climbed dramatically (from $48.9B to $98.0B) . Broadcom took on VMware’s deferred revenue liabilities and issued new debt. Specifically, Broadcom’s *long-term debt* went from $18.4B in 2023 to $28.6B in 2024 , and current debt to $1.245B – but these figures seem low given the scale of the deal, implying a lot of stock was used. More impactfully, *other non-current liabilities* (likely deferred tax liabilities and obligations to VMware customers/employees) rose. **Ratios:** Broadcom’s **current ratio** is **1.17** – at FY2024 it had $19.6B current assets vs $16.7B current liabilities. This is adequate, though not overly high. The current assets include $9.35B cash, receivables of $6.33B, and inventories $1.76B , while current liabilities include accounts payable and accrued expenses (combined \~$4.2B) and short-term debt $1.245B . Broadcom’s **debt-to-equity ratio** (interest-bearing debt to equity) is about **1.29**(129%) , meaning it has more debt than equity. This increased post-acquisition: Broadcom used substantial borrowing for VMware. A D/E above 1 signals high leverage. However, Broadcom generates strong cash flows (from its semiconductor and enterprise software businesses) which it uses to pay down debt over time. Its **equity ratio is \~40.9%** , so roughly 41% of assets are equity-funded, the rest by liabilities. This is a noticeable change – in 2023, equity was only \~33% of assets (Broadcom was already leveraged). **Interpretation:** Broadcom’s balance sheet leverage is higher than the typical tech firm, but that’s partly due to its acquisition strategy. The VMware deal was transformative – adding a large software business – and with it came a lot of intangible assets and debt. Broadcom’s strategy is to acquire companies with steady cash flows (like VMware, CA Technologies, etc.) and use those cash flows to service debt and pay dividends. This means a higher tolerance for debt. The current ratio above 1 suggests Broadcom can meet near-term obligations, but not with a huge cushion – it runs a relatively tight ship on working capital (which is common in the semiconductor industry where inventory and receivables are well-managed). Post-acquisition, Broadcom had around $10.7B in cash on hand (Q3 2025\) , giving it some liquidity buffer. **Trends:** In the year after the acquisition (2025), Broadcom has likely focused on integrating VMware and achieving cost synergies, which could improve profitability and help reduce debt. Already by Aug 2025, liabilities were down slightly to $92.3B and equity up to $73.3B , indicating some debt paydown and retained earnings. In summary, Broadcom’s balance sheet reflects a **highly acquisitive strategy** – big intangibles, significant debt – but also robust equity growth. The **debt-to-equity of \~1.3** is the highest among these top companies, implying more financial risk, but Broadcom’s strong operating cash flow (over $16B/year) provides comfort. Investors will watch that Broadcom keeps its leverage in check and maintains liquidity above 1.0 current ratio. So far it appears to be managing well, as the VMware integration progresses and the company continues generating cash from both chip sales and software subscriptions.

### **Eli Lilly and Company (FY 2024\)**

Eli Lilly, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms, saw its balance sheet expand rapidly in 2023–2024 thanks to the success of its new drugs (like Mounjaro for diabetes/obesity) and strategic acquisitions. At the end of 2024, Lilly had **$78.7 billion in assets**, **$64.4 billion in liabilities**, and **$14.3 billion in shareholders’ equity** . Lilly’s **equity ratio is only \~18%**, the lowest of this group – meaning the vast majority of its assets (over 80%) are financed by liabilities, not equity . This is partly because Lilly, like many pharma companies, took on debt to fund R\&D and acquisitions, and also because it returns a lot of capital via dividends, keeping equity relatively small. **Changes and components:** Lilly’s assets jumped from $64.0B in 2023 to $78.7B in 2024 . Key drivers were *accounts receivable* and *inventory*, which swelled due to huge demand for its drugs. Accounts receivable rose to $11.0B in 2024 from $9.1B , and inventory to $7.59B from $5.77B, as Lilly ramped up production of Mounjaro and other medications . Also striking is Lilly’s cash position: it was relatively low at $3.27B in 2024, but by Q3 2025 Lilly’s cash rocketed to $9.79B . This cash increase likely came from operations (its new drugs generated a surge in revenue) and perhaps some debt issuance. On the **liability** side, Lilly’s debt load is substantial. Long-term debt was $28.6B in 2024 (up from $18.4B in 2023\) – Lilly issued significant debt, possibly to finance acquisitions like Prevail Therapeutics or others and to build manufacturing capacity. Current debt was $0.78B . So total debt \~$29.4B, *double* the company’s equity of $14.3B – hence a **debt-to-equity ratio of \~2.06 (206%)** , easily the highest D/E among these companies. In addition, Lilly has large other liabilities: *current liabilities* of $28.4B include accounts payable, accrued expenses (for marketing, research, etc.), and *customer advances* (perhaps collaboration payments from partners) which we see as a big jump in “Other current liabilities” to $447.9M in 2024 and $19.3B by Q3 2025 (that $19.3B in other current assets by Q3 2025 corresponds to a liability or adjustment elsewhere – possibly related to a large upfront payment from a partner or a reclassification). Lilly’s *current ratio* was **1.15** in 2024 ($32.74B current assets vs $28.38B current liab), which is reasonable but not high. By Q3 2025, current assets soared to $62.1B (with that big other current asset) vs current liab $40.1B , improving the current ratio to \~1.55. **Interpretation:** Lilly’s balance sheet shows a company in aggressive growth mode, leveraging debt to seize a huge market opportunity (the obesity/diabetes drug market) and to invest in future drugs. The low equity is partly due to heavy **shareholder payouts** – Lilly pays dividends and its equity grew only modestly despite strong profits because it also did share buybacks. For instance, retained earnings were only $11.0B by 2024, suggesting most earnings have been paid out or offset by charges. The **high debt-to-equity (206%)** means Lilly is quite leveraged financially. However, pharma companies often carry debt comfortably if their products are blockbusters – investors don’t mind debt if cash flows are strong and predictable (patent-protected drugs can generate billions in steady cash). Still, Lilly’s interest costs will rise with this debt, and it must be careful in a higher interest rate environment. The good news is Lilly’s new product launches have been extremely successful, swelling its cash from operations (as seen by the cash jump in 2025). **Overall**, Lilly’s balance sheet is the most leveraged of the top 10: only **18% equity**. Its current ratio \~1.1–1.5 is adequate for now, but not too high – Lilly must manage short-term obligations prudently (pharma companies sometimes have large legal or settlement liabilities, for example). The big increase in assets and liabilities in 2024–2025 tells the story of a pharma company scaling up: more inventory to sell, more receivables from customers (wholesalers/insurers), and more debt to fund expansions and acquisitions. Investors will be watching Lilly’s debt levels relative to its earnings. If the new drugs continue to drive growth, Lilly will likely pay down some debt and strengthen its equity (via retained earnings). In summary, **Lilly is leveraging its balance sheet to capitalize on growth opportunities** – a higher-risk, higher-reward stance compared to the cash-rich tech giants. The expectation is that its strong product sales will quickly justify and alleviate this leverage, improving the balance sheet in coming years (for example, turning that debt into equity via profits).

---

**Conclusion:** The balance sheets of these top S\&P 500 companies reveal both common traits of large, successful firms and unique aspects of their industries. Most have **ample liquidity** (current ratios generally above 1, often well above) and *strong equity bases*, reflecting consistent profitability. **High-tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia)** tend to carry *low debt relative to equity*, relying more on internal funds – they show debt-to-equity ratios under 0.3 (except Apple, which strategically leverages debt for buybacks). Their equity ratios (portion of assets funded by equity) are correspondingly high, indicating financial conservatism and the capacity to weather downturns. **Companies that made large acquisitions or have high capital needs (Broadcom, Lilly)** show higher leverage and lower equity proportions, as they intentionally take on debt to fuel growth. **Berkshire Hathaway**, a conglomerate, stands out with a colossal asset base financed by a unique liability structure (insurance float) and an enormous equity cushion – it demonstrates how an insurance-driven balance sheet can be both leveraged (by float) and ultra-strong (high equity and cash). By analyzing metrics like the current ratio, we gauged short-term financial health – e.g. Apple’s sub-1 current ratio is mitigated by its cash generation, whereas Nvidia’s 4.4 ratio signals a large cash surplus. The debt-to-equity ratio highlighted each firm’s risk appetite: from Alphabet’s virtually debt-free stance to Lilly’s heavy borrowing. And the equity ratio showed how much “skin in the game” shareholders have – with Alphabet and Nvidia around 70% (shareholders finance most assets) versus Lilly at 18% (shareholders finance little, creditors finance a lot). These measures give context: **a higher current ratio and equity ratio generally imply a more liquid, solvent company, whereas a higher debt-to-equity means more financial risk but also potentially higher return on equity** if managed well.

In essence, all top 10 companies analyzed are financially solid, but their balance sheets align with their strategies: the big tech firms and Berkshire are **fortresses of liquidity and low leverage**, prioritizing financial flexibility, while Broadcom and Lilly are **more leveraged, using debt** as a tool for expansion in a calculated way. Investors and stakeholders can take comfort in the overall strength of these balance sheets – even the more leveraged companies maintain investment-grade profiles – and will continue to monitor these metrics as indicators of future strategic moves and risk management. By understanding the components and ratios of the balance sheet, we gain insight into how each of these corporate giants balances growth, risk, and financial stability on the ledger of assets and liabilities that underpin their business.
