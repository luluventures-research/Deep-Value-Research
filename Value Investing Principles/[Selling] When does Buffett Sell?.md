# **An Investment Memorandum: A Disciplined Framework for Divestment**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **1.0 Introduction: Redefining "Long-Term Holding" for Active Portfolio Management**

This memorandum establishes the formal, logic-based framework our firm will employ for divesting from portfolio assets. The guiding principle is to move beyond the common misinterpretation of "long-term investing" as a passive "buy-and-forget" strategy. While patience is a virtue in investing, it must not become a justification for inaction. Many investors are familiar with the adage, "If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes." While this highlights the importance of conviction, it is often misconstrued as a command to hold on indefinitely, regardless of changing circumstances.

The core argument of this framework is that disciplined selling is a critical, and often more difficult, component of value creation than buying. The myth of never selling is easily dispelled by observing the actions of disciplined investors like Warren Buffett, who famously sold his entire position in airline stocks in 2020\. Holding an asset for a decade is only a viable strategy if the underlying investment thesis remains intact and compelling. This document provides a guiding philosophy and a set of actionable tenets to ensure that every asset in the firm's portfolio earns its place through active, rational evaluation.

## **2.0 The Guiding Philosophy: The Portfolio as an Actively Managed System**

Our guiding philosophy is that the portfolio is a dynamic system requiring active management, a principle best understood through the complementary lenses of a gardener cultivating a plot and a retailer managing shelf space. The garden analogy speaks to the health and potential of individual assets, while the retail analogy emphasizes the critical, overarching concept of opportunity cost and capital productivity. Together, they frame the investor's role not as a passive owner, but as an active manager of capital.

### **The Portfolio as a Garden**

An investor must act as a diligent gardener whose primary job is to cultivate a collection of healthy, growing assets. This requires consistent attention and a willingness to make difficult decisions. A gardener must perform three essential actions to ensure the long-term health of the garden:

1. **Weed Out Sick or Rotting Plants.** If a tree becomes diseased and begins to rot, it must be removed. This is analogous to selling an underperforming asset where the fundamental thesis has been broken. Letting it remain threatens the health of the entire garden.  
2. **Make Space for Better Seeds.** A garden has finite space. If an exceptional new seed is discovered, it may be necessary to remove a perfectly healthy, but less promising, plant to make room for it to grow. This illustrates the principle of opportunity cost—selling a good asset to fund an exceptional one.  
3. **Prune Overgrown Trees.** If a tree grows so tall that it risks touching a power line, it becomes dangerous. A wise gardener prunes it back to a safe size. This is equivalent to trimming a position that has become excessively overvalued and represents a concentrated, uncompensated risk to the portfolio.

### **The Portfolio as Retail Shelf Space**

Investment capital is a finite resource, much like the shelf space in a supermarket. Every product on the shelf must justify its position. In this analogy, a losing stock is a "rotten banana." The true cost of holding onto it is twofold:

* The direct loss on the spoiled product itself.  
* The far greater **opportunity cost** of the valuable shelf space it occupies. That space could be used to display a best-selling product, generating significant returns.

Holding a losing asset ties up capital that could be redeployed into a superior investment. Refusing to sell because it would mean realizing a loss is not patience; it is a failure to recognize that the primary goal is to maximize the productivity of every dollar of capital. These two analogies provide the foundation for the three core tenets of our divestment strategy.

## **3.0 The Three Core Tenets for Divestment**

A disciplined divestment strategy replaces emotional decision-making—such as fear during a market downturn or greed during a rally—with a repeatable, analytical process. There are only three primary, logic-driven reasons for selling an asset.

### **3.1 Tenet 1: Thesis Invalidation & Fundamental Deterioration**

This is the "I was wrong" principle. A position must be sold when the original reasons for making the investment are no longer valid, regardless of the current profit or loss.

The most effective application of this tenet occurs when a company's fundamentals undergo a *permanent, structural change* for the worse. A classic example is Warren Buffett's decision to sell his airline holdings in 2020\. His original thesis was based on projections of stable, long-term cash flow. The global pandemic, however, threatened a permanent, structural change to business and leisure travel, rendering the original cash-flow models invalid. When the facts change this profoundly, the only logical action is to sell. As a critical reminder:

*The stock doesn't know you bought it; it won't go back up just because you are at a loss.*

### **3.2 Tenet 2: The Discipline of Opportunity Cost**

This tenet dictates that it is not only acceptable but often necessary to sell a *good* investment to fund an identifiably *better*one, especially when fresh capital is unavailable.

This is a pure calculation of relative value and is the essence of effective asset allocation. For instance, imagine you hold Stock A, which you project will deliver a respectable 10% annual return. You then identify Stock B, which has a similar risk profile but offers a prospective 20% annual return. If you have no available cash, the rational choice is to reallocate capital from Stock A to Stock B. The decision to sell Stock A is not an indictment of its quality, but rather a disciplined recognition that capital should be deployed where it can generate the highest potential return.

### **3.3 Tenet 3: Extreme Overvaluation**

This tenet applies when an asset's market price becomes "absurdly expensive," fundamentally disconnecting from its underlying business value and future prospects.

Consider the simple analogy of a lemonade stand that reliably earns $10,000 per year. If an investor suddenly offers you $10 million for the stand, the only logical decision is to sell. That price represents 1,000 years of earnings—a valuation that is impossible to justify fundamentally. Selling in this scenario is a rational response to the market's "extreme craziness," where decades of future growth have already been priced in, leaving the holder with a deeply unfavorable risk/reward profile.

Executing Tenet 1 effectively, however, is not always straightforward. It hinges on a critical diagnostic skill: the ability to distinguish between a temporary market panic and a permanent, structural decline in the underlying business.

## **4.0 Diagnostic Framework: Distinguishing Cyclical Downturn from Structural Decline**

The most significant errors in portfolio management often arise from misdiagnosing *why* a stock's price is falling. Mistaking a permanent structural decline for a temporary cyclical downturn can lead to catastrophic capital loss. This framework provides a tool for correctly applying Tenet 1\.

### **Cyclical Downturn (A Time for Patience)**

A cyclical downturn is characterized by a temporary market-wide or industry-specific panic. In this scenario, the stock price falls, but the company's underlying fundamentals, competitive advantages, and long-term prospects remain strong or are even improving. A prime example is Amazon during the dot-com bust of 2000\. While its stock price plummeted with the rest of the market, the company's core business was strengthening. For investors who correctly diagnosed the situation, it was a time to hold or even add to their position.

### **Structural Decline (A Mandate to Sell)**

A structural decline signifies a permanent erosion of a company's business model or competitive advantage. This is not a downturn from which the company will likely recover; it is a "value trap." Holding on in this scenario is a critical error. Clear examples include:

* **Nokia** in the smartphone era, whose dominance in mobile phones was permanently erased by the iPhone and Android.  
* **Kodak** in the digital camera era, whose film-based business model was rendered obsolete by a technological shift it failed to navigate.

The core principle is this: "faith" in an investment must be grounded in its fundamentals. If the original reasons for buying the company—such as its high-growth trajectory or its monopoly status—have vanished, then continuing to hold the asset is not discipline. It is a refusal to accept reality. Failing to make this distinction carries severe quantitative costs.

## **5.0 The High Cost of Inaction: Quantifying the Dangers of Holding Losing Assets**

Beyond the qualitative reasons for divesting, there are severe and quantifiable financial consequences to passively holding a losing investment in the hope of merely breaking even. This approach, often mistaken for long-term investing, is a form of financial self-sabotage.

The mathematical reality of recovering from a significant loss is stark and unforgiving:

1. A **50% loss** requires a **100% gain** just to get back to the starting point.  
2. A **90% loss** requires an astonishing **900% gain** to break even, an outcome described as almost impossible in mature markets.

Furthermore, the opportunity cost of tying up capital in a stagnant or declining asset is immense. Consider the following 10-year scenario comparing two approaches to a position that has fallen 50%:

| Scenario | Initial Capital | Action | Outcome After 10 Years | Net Result |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **A: "Hold and Hope"** | $100,000 | Hold a losing stock that eventually breaks even. | $100,000 | **Capital frozen; a decade of market gains forfeited.** |
| **B: "Sell and Reinvest"** | $100,000 | Sell at a 50% loss ($50,000). Reinvest in the S\&P 500 at 10% annual return. | \~$130,000 | **Capital redeployed; opportunity captured and compounding.** |

The key takeaway is that the true loss in Scenario A is not simply the decade of 0% returns. The investor in that scenario has also **forfeited the entire market's average gains** during that period. Selling, even at a loss, frees up capital to work productively elsewhere, whereas clinging to a losing position ensures that you lose both money *and* time.

## **6.0 Conclusion: A Commitment to a Logic-Driven Divestment Process**

Effective portfolio management requires more than just skill in identifying assets to buy; it demands a disciplined, unemotional, and logical framework for knowing when to sell. Passively holding assets under the guise of "long-term investing" without actively re-evaluating their merit is a recipe for underperformance and, in some cases, permanent capital impairment.

This memorandum establishes that every divestment decision should be rooted in one of three core tenets, which serve as the foundation of our selling philosophy:

* Sell when the **fundamentals have permanently deteriorated** and the original investment thesis is broken.  
* Sell to redeploy capital into a **demonstrably superior opportunity**.  
* Sell when the **valuation becomes irrationally extreme**.

Crucially, the decision to sell should never be driven by the fear of a falling price. It must be a conscious, strategic choice based on the principles outlined. Before any sale is executed, every manager must answer three questions: "Is the thesis broken? Have I found a better use for this capital? Is the price absurd?" If the answer to all three questions is no, then maintaining the position is the only disciplined course of action.
