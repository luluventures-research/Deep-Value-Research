# Recession Analysis - Historical Performance Assessment

This reference document provides detailed guidance on analyzing company performance through economic recessions to assess business quality and resilience.

## Philosophy: Why Recessions Reveal Truth

> **"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."** — Warren Buffett

### The Recession Test Principle

**Good times hide problems:**
- Rising tide lifts all boats (even bad businesses grow)
- Cheap credit masks poor unit economics
- Customer tolerance higher during prosperity
- Competitive pressure lower in expanding markets

**Recessions reveal character:**
- True pricing power shows (customers stick despite hardship)
- Capital efficiency matters (wasteful companies struggle)
- Balance sheet strength critical (debt destroys overleveraged)
- Management quality exposed (crisis decisions matter)

**The Forever Hold Test:**
> "A business that can survive and thrive through recessions, maintaining profitability and competitive position, demonstrates the durability required for a long-term investment."

## Major Recessions for Analysis

### For 20+ Year Data (2004-2024): Analyze ALL Three

```
1. 2001 Dot-Com Bust (if data extends back)
   - Tech-specific, broader economic impact
   - Duration: March 2001 - November 2001

2. 2008-2009 Financial Crisis ⭐ CRITICAL
   - Most severe since Great Depression
   - Duration: December 2007 - June 2009

3. 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic ⭐ CRITICAL
   - Sudden, external shock
   - Duration: February 2020 - April 2020 (official), impacts extended
```

### For 15+ Year Data (2009-2024): Analyze Two

```
1. 2008-2009 Financial Crisis ⭐ CRITICAL
2. 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic ⭐ CRITICAL
```

### For 10+ Year Data (2014-2024): Analyze One

```
1. 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic ⭐ MINIMUM REQUIREMENT
```

**If company data misses ALL recessions:**
```
❌ CRITICAL LIMITATION
Cannot assess recession performance
Company UNPROVEN in crisis
Significant uncertainty about durability
Use with extreme caution
```

## Recession Analysis Framework

### PHASE 1: Pre-Recession Positioning (12-24 months before)

**Assess company's position entering recession:**

```
Financial Strength Assessment:

Balance Sheet:
- Debt/Equity ratio: ___
- Current ratio: ___
- Cash & equivalents: $___M
- Available credit lines: $___M
Total liquidity: $___M

Profitability:
- Operating margin: ___%
- ROIC: ___%
- FCF generation: $___M

Assessment:
[ ] Fortress balance sheet (low debt, high cash)
[ ] Moderate leverage (manageable)
[ ] Vulnerable (high debt, low cash)

Strong Position = Better able to weather + invest during crisis
Weak Position = Survival mode, may need desperate actions
```

**Competitive Position:**

```
Market share: ___%
Market position: #___ in industry
Pricing power evidence: ___
Customer concentration: ___% (top 5)

Assessment:
[ ] Market leader with pricing power (offensive capability)
[ ] Solid #2-3 player (defensive capability)
[ ] Weak position (vulnerable to market share loss)
```

**Business Model Resilience:**

```
Revenue Model:
[ ] Recurring/subscription (high visibility)
[ ] Long-term contracts (protected)
[ ] Transaction-based (cyclical)
[ ] Project-based (lumpy, vulnerable)

Customer Type:
[ ] Non-discretionary needs (food, healthcare)
[ ] Discretionary but sticky (entertainment subscriptions)
[ ] Luxury/discretionary (first to cut)
[ ] B2B cyclical (amplified cycles)

Assessment:
Recession resilience: High / Medium / Low
```

### PHASE 2: During Recession Performance

#### Test 1: Revenue Resilience

**Measure revenue decline from peak to trough:**

```
Example: 2008-2009 Financial Crisis

| Quarter | Revenue | YoY Change | vs. Peak |
|---------|---------|------------|----------|
| Q2 2008 | $500M | +10% | PEAK |
| Q3 2008 | $490M | +5% | -2% |

| Q3 2009 | $460M | -6% | -8% |
| Q4 2009 | $480M | 0% | -4% |

Peak-to-Trough Revenue Decline: -12%

Scoring:
0% to -5% = ✅✅ Exceptional (barely impacted)
-5% to -15% = ✅ Strong (modest decline)
-15% to -30% = ⚠️ Moderate (significant impact)
>-30% = ❌ Severe (major vulnerability)

Compare to:

- S&P 500 decline: ___%
- GDP decline: ___%

Relative Performance:
Better than industry = ✅ Gained share
In line with industry = ⚠️ Held share
Worse than industry = ❌ Lost share
```

**Recession Revenue Resilience Score: ___/20**

#### Test 2: Profitability Maintenance

**Critical question: Did company stay profitable?**

## Industry-Specific Recession Patterns

### Consumer Staples (Expected: High Resilience)

```
Examples: Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Costco

Typical Pattern:
- Revenue decline: 0% to -5% (non-discretionary)
- Margin compression: Minimal (pricing power)
- Market share: Often gains (trading down from premium)
- Recovery: Fast (never really declined)

Benchmark Recession Scores:
Revenue Resilience: 18-20/20
Profitability: 18-20/20
Cash Flow: 18-20/20
Balance Sheet: 18-20/20
Recovery: 18-20/20
Market Share: 15-20/20
TOTAL: 105-120/120

If a "consumer staple" scores <90/120:
⚠️ WARNING: Not truly non-discretionary or weak competitive position
```

### Technology (Expected: Moderate to Volatile)

```
Examples: Microsoft, Apple, Salesforce

Typical Pattern:
- Revenue decline: -10% to -20% (B2B cuts IT spending)
- Margin compression: Variable (fixed costs vs pricing power)
- Market share: Leaders gain, weak players die
- Recovery: Fast for leaders, slow/never for weak

Benchmark Recession Scores:
Strong Tech (MSFT, AAPL): 90-110/120
Moderate Tech (enterprise software): 70-90/120
Weak Tech (no moat): 40-70/120

If a tech company scores >100/120:
✅✅ Exceptional - has transcended tech volatility (Microsoft-like)
```

### Financials (Expected: Severe Impact)

```
Examples: JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Banks

Typical Pattern:
- Revenue decline: -20% to -40% (pro-cyclical)
- Margin compression: Severe (credit losses spike)
- Market share: Consolidation (weak banks fail)
- Recovery: Slow (regulatory, trust rebuilding)

Benchmark Recession Scores:
Top-tier banks: 60-80/120
Regional banks: 40-60/120
Troubled banks: 0-40/120

If a bank scores >80/120:
✅✅ Fortress bank - extremely well-managed (JPMorgan 2008-09)
```

### Industrials/Manufacturing (Expected: Cyclical Severe)

```
Examples: Caterpillar, Deere, 3M

Typical Pattern:
- Revenue decline: -30% to -50% (CapEx frozen)
- Margin compression: Extreme (fixed costs, low volumes)
- Market share: Stable (oligopoly)
- Recovery: Slow (CapEx cycle takes years)

Benchmark Recession Scores:
Strong industrials: 50-70/120
Weak industrials: 20-50/120

If an industrial scores >70/120:
✅ Exceptional execution given cyclicality (rare)
```

### Luxury/Discretionary (Expected: Severe Decline, Fast Recovery)

```
Examples: LVMH, Hermès, Ferrari

Typical Pattern:
- Revenue decline: -20% to -30% (wealthy cut back temporarily)
- Margin compression: Moderate (pricing power to ultra-wealthy)
- Market share: Consolidation (premium > mass market)
- Recovery: V-shaped (wealthy bounce back fast)

Benchmark Recession Scores:
True luxury: 60-80/120
Aspirational/mass luxury: 40-60/120

If a luxury brand scores >80/120:
✅✅ Exceptional - serves truly wealthy (recession-proof clientele)
```

## Remember

> **"We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful."** — Warren Buffett

**The purpose of recession analysis:**
1. Identify businesses that THRIVE in crisis (not just survive)
2. Validate pricing power and competitive moat under stress
3. Assess management quality when it matters most
4. Find companies that emerge STRONGER from recessions

**A company that scores >100/120 across multiple recessions is a Forever Hold candidate.**

**Recession = The ultimate truth serum for business quality.**
