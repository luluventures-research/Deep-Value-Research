# Competitive Moat Assessment - Deep Reference

This reference document provides detailed guidance on identifying, testing, and measuring durable competitive advantages (moats).

## The Moat Philosophy

> "The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage." — Warren Buffett

**Core Principle:** A moat must be structural, not circumstantial. It should widen over time, not require constant re-excavation.

## The Four Primary Moat Types

### 1. Intangible Assets (Brand, Patents, Licenses)

**Definition:** Value created by brand recognition, patents, or regulatory licenses that competitors cannot replicate.

**Examples:**
- Coca-Cola (brand worth premium vs. generic cola)
- Hermès (brand as exclusivity signal)
- Pharmaceutical patents (20-year monopoly)
- Banking licenses (regulatory barrier)

**Testing Brand Moat:**

```
Test 1: Premium Pricing Power
Question: Can the company charge 10-20% more than generic equivalent?
Evidence: Price premium × sustained market share over 10+ years

Test 2: Blind Taste Test
Question: If brand removed, would customers still pay premium?
Coca-Cola: Maybe not (tastes similar)
Hermès: Absolutely not (brand IS the product)

Test 3: Switching Cost for Emotion
Question: Do customers have emotional attachment to brand?
Evidence: Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer loyalty data
```

**Quantitative Indicators:**

| Metric | Benchmark | Weak Moat | Strong Moat |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Gross Margin** | Industry Avg | <40% | >60% consistently |
| **Brand Value/Market Cap** | N/A | <10% | >30% |
| **Price Premium** | Generic equivalent | <5% | >20% |
| **Market Share Stability** | 10-year trend | Declining | Stable/Growing |

**Patent Moat Assessment:**

```
1. Patent Portfolio Size: ___ patents
2. Core patents expiring: When? ___
3. Patent litigation history: ___
4. R&D pipeline: ___ (replacement products)

Strong patent moat if:
- Multiple layers of patents (not single patent dependency)
- Continuous innovation pipeline
- 10+ years of remaining protection on core products
```

---

### 2. Switching Costs

**Definition:** High friction (financial, time, risk) for customers to switch to competitors.

**Examples:**
- Bloomberg Terminal ($20K+/year, traders rely on muscle memory)
- Microsoft Office (retraining costs, file compatibility)
- SAP/Oracle ERP (months to implement, painful to rip out)
- Bankcards (automatic bill payments locked in)

**Testing Switching Cost Moat:**

```
Test 1: Quantify Switching Cost
Direct costs: Migration fees, new hardware/software: $___
Indirect costs: Training, productivity loss, risk: $___
Total switching cost: $___
As % of annual spend: ___%

>50% = Strong switching costs
20-50% = Moderate switching costs
<20% = Weak switching costs

Test 2: Customer Tenure
Average customer relationship: ___ years
Customer churn rate: ___% annually

<5% churn = Strong switching costs
5-15% churn = Moderate
>15% churn = Weak

Test 3: Interview Evidence (Fisher's Scuttlebutt)
Ask customers: "Have you considered switching?"
Answers indicating strong moat:
- "Too expensive/risky to switch"
- "Our entire workflow depends on it"
- "Data is locked in their format"
```

**Quantitative Indicators:**

| Metric | Weak Moat | Moderate Moat | Strong Moat |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Customer Retention** | <80% | 80-90% | >90% |
| **Net Revenue Retention (SaaS)** | <100% | 100-110% | >120% |
| **ROIC** | <10% | 10-15% | >20% |
| **Customer Acquisition Cost Payback** | >24 months | 12-24 months | <12 months |

**The Lock-In Test:**

```
Evidence of Customer Lock-In:
[ ] Multi-year contracts (3+ years)
[ ] Data stored in proprietary format
[ ] Integration with critical workflows
[ ] Certification/training required (specialized knowledge)
[ ] Network effects within customer's ecosystem

5/5 = Exceptionally strong switching costs
3-4/5 = Strong
1-2/5 = Moderate
0/5 = Weak (commoditized)
```

---

### 3. Network Effects

**Definition:** Product/service becomes more valuable as more people use it.

**Types of Network Effects:**

**Direct Network Effects:**
- Each additional user directly increases value to existing users
- Examples: Facebook (more friends = more value), Telephone network

**Indirect Network Effects (Platform/Marketplace):**
- More buyers attract more sellers, which attracts more buyers (flywheel)
- Examples: eBay, Amazon Marketplace, Uber

**Data Network Effects:**
- More users → more data → better product → more users
- Examples: Google Search, Waze navigation

**Testing Network Effect Moat:**

```
Test 1: Value Acceleration
Question: Does the product become MORE valuable (not just same value) as users grow?

Measure: Value per user vs. total users
If value/user INCREASING with scale = True network effect
If value/user FLAT with scale = Scale economies (not network effect)

Test 2: Liquidity/Thickness
For marketplaces:
- Average time to transaction: ___
- Fill rate (% of requests fulfilled): ___%

Strong network effect if:
- Instant matches (Uber: <5 min wait)
- >95% fill rate
- Getting better over time

Test 3: Multi-Homing Cost
Question: Do users need to use ONLY this platform, or can they use multiple?

Low multi-homing cost = Weaker moat (can use Uber AND Lyft)
High multi-homing cost = Stronger moat (can't be on Facebook AND MySpace effectively)
```

**Quantitative Indicators:**

| Metric | Weak | Moderate | Strong |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| **User Growth Rate** | <10% YoY | 10-30% YoY | >30% YoY |
| **Engagement (DAU/MAU)** | <30% | 30-50% | >50% |
| **Gross Margin** | <50% | 50-70% | >80% |
| **CAC Payback** | >24 mo | 12-24 mo | <12 mo |
| **Network Density (connections per user)** | Stable | Slowly growing | Accelerating |

**The Critical Mass Test:**

```
Has the company reached "critical mass" where network effects kick in?

Evidence:
1. Dominant market share in category: ___% (#1 position)
2. Competitors struggling despite funding
3. User growth accelerating (not linear)
4. Engagement metrics improving with scale

Critical Mass Indicator:
= When company has >50% market share + users prefer NOT to multi-home
```

### 4. Cost Advantages

**Definition:** Structural advantages allowing production/delivery at lower cost than competitors.

**Sources of Cost Advantages:**

**a) Scale Economies:**
- Fixed costs spread over more units
- Examples: Walmart (distribution scale), Costco (buying power)

**b) Process/Technology:**
- Proprietary manufacturing process
- Examples: TSMC (semiconductor process), Danaher (DBS lean manufacturing)

**c) Unique Assets:**
- Cheaper inputs, strategic locations
- Examples: Low-cost energy source, favorable real estate

**d) Learning Curve:**
- Experience lowers costs over time
- Examples: Aerospace manufacturing, complex assembly

**Testing Cost Advantage Moat:**

```
Test 1: Cost Structure Comparison
Company's cost structure:
- COGS as % of revenue: ___%
- Operating expenses: ___%
- TOTAL COSTS: ___%

Competitor average:
- TOTAL COSTS: ___%

Cost advantage: ___% (Company costs - Competitor costs)

>5% advantage = Strong cost moat
2-5% advantage = Moderate
<2% = Weak (commodity)

Test 2: Operating Leverage
Revenue +10% → Operating Income +___%

>20% = Strong operating leverage (scale benefits)
10-20% = Moderate
<10% = Weak
```

**Quantitative Indicators:**

| Metric | Weak Moat | Moderate Moat | Strong Moat |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Gross Margin vs. Competitors** | Equal/lower | +2-5 pts | +5-10 pts |
| **Operating Margin vs. Competitors** | Equal/lower | +2-4 pts | +5+ pts |
| **Asset Turnover** | <1.0 | 1.0-2.0 | >2.0 |
| **ROIC** | <10% | 10-15% | >15% |

**The Replication Test:**

```
Question: How much would it cost a competitor to replicate our cost structure?

Examples:
- Walmart distribution network: $50B+ and 20 years
- TSMC fabs: $20B per fab, 5+ years to build
- Amazon fulfillment network: $100B+, 10+ years

If replication cost >$1B and >5 years = Strong moat
If replication cost <$100M and <2 years = Weak moat
```

## Fake Moat Rejection Criteria

**The following are NOT durable moats (reject immediately):**

### 1. Technological Leadership (Usually Temporary)

```
❌ "We have the best technology"
❌ "Our product is superior"
❌ "We're 2 years ahead of competition"

WHY NOT A MOAT:
- Technology can be leapfrogged (Nokia → iPhone)
- "Best" changes every 6-12 months in tech
- Requires constant massive R&D to maintain (not structural)

EXCEPTION: Technology moat ONLY if:
+ Protected by patents with 10+ years remaining
+ Network effects make technology standard (QWERTY keyboard)
+ Switching costs lock in customers (proprietary format)
```

### 2. Operational Excellence (Can Be Copied)

```
❌ "We execute better than competitors"
❌ "Our management is superior"
❌ "Better culture/employees"

WHY NOT A MOAT:
- Management changes
- Competitors can hire away talent
- Best practices diffuse across industry

EXCEPTION: Operational excellence IS a moat ONLY if:
+ Embedded in culture for 20+ years (See's Candies, Costco)
+ Demonstrated through economic cycles
+ Manifests as cost advantage or pricing power
```

### 3. Regulatory Advantage (Can Disappear)

```
❌ "Government contract gives us advantage"
❌ "Regulation limits competition"
❌ "License barrier to entry"

WHY NOT A MOAT:
- Regulations change (Utility deregulation, telecom breakup)
- Contracts expire and re-bid
- Political winds shift

EXCEPTION: Regulatory moat ONLY if:
+ Entrenched for 50+ years (utilities in some regions)
+ Politically impossible to change (water utilities)
+ Combined with high switching costs
```

### 4. First-Mover Advantage (Often Fleeting)

```
❌ "We were first to market"
❌ "Brand recognition from being first"

WHY NOT A MOAT:
- Friendster was first (lost to Facebook)
- Yahoo was first search (lost to Google)
- MySpace was first social network (lost to Facebook)

EXCEPTION: First-mover IS a moat ONLY if:
+ Network effects reached critical mass
+ Switching costs prevent migration
+ Brand became generic term (Kleenex, Google)
```

## The Ultimate Moat Test: Pricing Power

> "The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power." — Warren Buffett

**Pricing Power Test Framework:**

### Test 1: Price Increase Elasticity

```
Scenario: Company raises prices 10%

Measure customer response:
Option A: Lose <2% of customers = ✅✅ Exceptional pricing power
Option B: Lose 2-5% of customers = ✅ Strong pricing power
Option C: Lose 5-10% of customers = ⚠️ Moderate pricing power
Option D: Lose >10% of customers = ❌ No pricing power (commodity)

HISTORICAL EVIDENCE (Required):
Show 10-year history of price increases and volume impact:

| Year | Price Change | Volume Change | Net Revenue Impact |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 2014 | +3% | -1% | +2% |
| 2015 | +2% | 0% | +2% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 2024 | +5% | -1% | +4% |

Strong pricing power = Consistent price increases with minimal volume loss
```

### Test 2: Price vs. Inflation

```
Company's Price Increases vs. Inflation:

| Year | Inflation | Company Price Δ | Spread |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| 2014 | 1.6% | 3% | +1.4% |
| 2015 | 0.1% | 2% | +1.9% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 2024 | 4.1% | 5% | +0.9% |

Pricing power evidence:
= Company consistently raises prices ABOVE inflation
= Margins expand or stay stable during inflationary periods

Strong moat = Price increases 2%+ above inflation consistently
```

### Test 3: Pass-Through Power (Cost Inflation)

```
When input costs rise, can company pass through to customers?

Example: Oil price spike in 2021-2022
Input cost increase: +30%
Company's price increase: +___%

Pass-through ratio = Price increase / Cost increase
>90% = ✅ Strong pricing power
50-90% = ⚠️ Moderate
<50% = ❌ Weak (absorbs costs in margin)
```

### Test 4: Luxury Paradox (Veblen Goods)

```
For ultra-luxury brands (Hermès, Ferrari):

Higher price = Higher demand (inverse demand curve)

Evidence:
- Waiting lists growing with price
- Exclusivity driving desire
- Price increase reinforces brand

Hermès Birkin bag:
- Price +200% over 10 years
- Demand +300%
- Pricing power: UNLIMITED
```

## Multi-Decade Moat Durability Assessment

**For companies with 20+ years of data:**

```
MOAT STRENGTH TREND ANALYSIS:

1. Gross Margin Trend (20 years):
| Decade | Avg Gross Margin | Trend |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| 2004-2013 | __% | - |
| 2014-2023 | __% | Widening/Stable/Eroding |

Moat widening = Gross margin expanding
Moat intact = Gross margin stable
Moat eroding = Gross margin declining

2. Market Share Trend:
| Decade | Market Share | Trend |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| 2004-2013 | __% | - |
| 2014-2023 | __% | Gaining/Stable/Losing |

3. ROIC Trend (Ultimate Moat Measure):
| Decade | Avg ROIC | Trend |
|--------|----------|-------|
| 2004-2013 | __% | - |
| 2014-2023 | __% | Rising/Stable/Falling |

MOAT DURABILITY SCORE:
All three improving = ✅✅ Widening moat
All three stable = ✅ Durable moat
One+ declining = ⚠️ Moat under pressure
All declining = ❌ Moat eroding
```

---

## Moat Width vs. Moat Durability

**Two separate assessments needed:**

### Moat Width (How strong TODAY)

```
Measured by:
- Current pricing power
- Current ROIC (vs. cost of capital)
- Current competitive advantage magnitude

Narrow moat: ROIC 12-15%, moderate pricing power
Wide moat: ROIC 15-25%, strong pricing power
Very wide moat: ROIC >25%, exceptional pricing power
```

### Moat Durability (How long it LASTS)

```
Measured by:
- Consistency over decades
- Resilience through disruptions
- Ability to withstand competitive attacks

Durable moat evidence:
- 20+ years of high ROIC
- Survived major technology shifts
- Competitors tried and failed to disrupt

Temporary moat evidence:
- High ROIC but <10 years
- Dependent on current technology
- Structural shift could eliminate advantage
```

**Ideal Investment: Wide AND Durable Moat**
