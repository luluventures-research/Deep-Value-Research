### The Investment Philosophy of Walter J. Schloss: A Commitment to Disciplined Value

##### Introduction: The Foundation of a "Superinvestor"

This document codifies the time-tested investment philosophy of Walter J. Schloss, a discipline forged over a half-century of navigating the complexities of the public markets. As a direct student of Benjamin Graham and designated by Warren Buffett as a true "superinvestor," Mr. Schloss developed a methodology rooted in simplicity, patience, and an unwavering focus on capital preservation. The remarkable long-term track record of this philosophy speaks for itself: over a period of nearly 50 years managing partner assets, a period that included 18 economic recessions, the strategy achieved a 16% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and a 1240-fold cumulative return.

#### 1.0 Core Philosophical Tenets: The Three Pillars of Prudent Investing

The entire investment process is built upon a small set of foundational principles. These tenets are not guidelines but non-negotiable axioms that govern every decision, providing a consistent and rational framework for navigating market volatility and identifying true, durable value. They represent the "why" behind the strategy, ensuring that every action is aligned with the core objective of protecting and patiently growing capital.

##### 1.1 The Primacy of Capital Preservation

The first and most important rule of investing is to not lose money. This simple, yet profound, belief is the starting point for the entire strategy. This aversion to permanent capital loss is the primary directive that governs every subsequent step of the process, from initial stock screening to portfolio construction and the ultimate sell decision.This principle is captured in the simple declaration:  **"I don't like to lose money."**  This is not a casual preference but the central governor of the investment engine, demanding a defensive posture and a relentless focus on downside protection above all else.

##### 1.2 The Bedrock of "Margin of Safety"

Inherited directly from Benjamin Graham, the principle of "Margin of Safety" is the primary tool for achieving capital preservation. It is a commitment to purchasing assets for significantly less than their underlying, demonstrable value. This creates a buffer that protects the investment against unforeseen business troubles, market downturns, or errors in judgment. The core tactic is straightforward and quantitatively driven:"I tend to buy stocks whose price is below the company's book value. This gives me a degree of protection."This principle was vividly illustrated by an early experience working with Graham on the acquisition of the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO). Graham’s logic in the transaction represents the ultimate expression of the Margin of Safety: an investment where the downside is protected not by forecasts of future success, but by the tangible, verifiable liquidation value of its assets.

##### 1.3 The Necessity of Emotional Discipline

The single most important trait for a successful value investor is the ability to control one's emotions. The stock market is often a field of emotional reactions, where fear and greed drive prices away from rational valuations. Success, therefore, is contingent upon a set of rational behaviors that insulate the investor from their own worst instincts:

1. **Detach from the Narrative:**  Actively avoid meeting with company management. Executives can be charismatic and persuasive, creating an emotional bias that can cloud objective financial judgment. This is a critical defense mechanism that protects the quantitative purity of the entire selection process; the investment case must rest solely on verifiable figures, not on the personalities running the company.  
2. **Act Against the Crowd:**  Understand that the market often overreacts to bad news. A company that is "in trouble" and surrounded by pessimism is frequently a source of opportunity. This fear creates the conditions where assets can be purchased cheaply, providing the desired margin of safety.  
3. **Invest Based on Facts, Not Forecasts:**  Make purchasing decisions based on the company's current, verifiable financial reality, not on speculation. The focus is on "present facts," such as the strength of the balance sheet, rather than "future possibilities," like the potential success of a new product or shifts in economic trends.These philosophical tenets provide the unwavering foundation upon which the practical, day-to-day investment process is built.

#### 2.0 The Investment Selection Process: A Quantitative and Contrarian Approach

The selection process is a systematic, data-driven methodology designed to uncover value where others are not looking. This philosophy mandates the deliberate ignorance of prevailing market sentiment, short-term economic forecasts, and speculative growth narratives. Instead, it demands a disciplined, repeatable screening process focused on quantifiable metrics of safety and value.

##### 2.1 Sourcing Opportunities

The primary hunting ground for potential investments is the list of stocks making new lows. A stock hitting a new low is often a clear signal that the company is facing trouble and has fallen out of favor with the broader market. This is precisely the environment where emotional selling can lead to significant price-to-value dislocations.

##### 2.2 Key Quantitative Criteria

Once a potential opportunity is identified, it is subjected to a rigorous evaluation based on a short list of non-negotiable financial metrics. Each criterion is a precondition for investment, designed to ensure a buffer of safety and align interests.

* **Low Debt:**  This is the most critical factor. Debt introduces significant risk, magnifies problems, and can ultimately lead to bankruptcy. This criterion works in direct concert with the sourcing strategy of seeking companies at new lows. A low-debt company facing "trouble" is a qualitatively superior opportunity; its clean balance sheet provides the resilience to withstand the very pressures that created the attractive price, turning a potential value trap into a high-potential value investment.  
* **Price Below Book Value:**  This is the primary method for establishing a quantifiable margin of safety. By purchasing shares for less than the company's net asset value as stated on its balance sheet, the investment is backed by tangible assets.  
* **Management's Skin in the Game:**  It is essential to confirm that the company's directors and senior management own a significant amount of stock. This is verified by reviewing annual reports and proxy statements. When management's personal wealth is tied to the company's shares, their interests are more closely aligned with those of outside shareholders.  
* **Long-Term Operating History:**  A company's history is reviewed over a 15- to 20-year period, often using resources like Value Line. This provides crucial insight into how the business has performed through various market cycles, revealing its underlying resilience and earning power absent the noise of short-term events.

##### 2.3 What to Deliberately Ignore

Just as important as what is analyzed is what is intentionally disregarded. The research process is defined by a clear distinction between objective data and subjective narrative.| Focus On (The Numbers) | Avoid (The Narrative) || \------ | \------ || Annual Reports & Proxy Statements | Meetings with Company Management || Balance Sheet (esp. Debt) | Short-Term Economic Trends or Market Predictions || Historical Financial Performance | Speculative Future Growth Stories (e.g., new tech) || Price vs. Book Value | Industries I Do Not Understand (e.g., computers) |  
This quantitative and contrarian selection process ensures that each stock entering the portfolio has first cleared a high bar for safety and value, forming the building blocks of a resilient collection of assets.

#### 3.0 Portfolio Construction and Risk Management

The Schloss philosophy dictates that risk management transcends individual security selection, demanding a robust portfolio architecture designed for systemic resilience. The primary goal is to structure the portfolio in such a way that no single investment failure can severely impact the overall fund, ensuring the preservation of partners' capital.

##### 3.1 Principle of Radical Diversification

The core risk management strategy is to hold a large and diverse portfolio of securities. The fund is typically comprised of  **over 100 different stocks** . This wide diversification is an explicit acknowledgment that mistakes and unforeseen problems are a part of investing. It builds a structure robust enough to withstand them without catastrophic loss.

##### 3.2 Prudent Position Sizing

Strict limits are placed on the maximum allowable allocation to any single stock. While a personal portfolio might tolerate a position size of up to 20%, a more conservative limit is a mandate when managing external capital. To ensure partners' peace of mind and mitigate the impact of any single company's failure, a maximum position size of approximately 10% is more appropriate.

##### 3.3 A Contrarian Buying Discipline

The principle of radical diversification is not merely a defensive measure; it is the essential precondition for the contrarian buying discipline. If a carefully selected stock declines in price after the initial purchase, it is viewed not as a mistake but as an opportunity. By ensuring no single position can inflict catastrophic damage, the portfolio architecture creates the psychological and financial fortitude required to act decisively when an individual holding declines. This practice of "averaging down" is based on the logic that if a company was a good value at a higher price, it is an even better value at a lower one.This disciplined approach to buying and structuring the portfolio creates a resilient foundation, which is then complemented by a pragmatic approach to selling.

#### 4.0 The Sell Discipline: A Pragmatic Approach to Realizing Value

The process for selling a stock is pragmatic rather than dogmatic. There is no fixed, automatic formula that dictates a sale. Instead, the approach is guided by the core principles of crystallizing profits when they become substantial and avoiding the emotional pain of watching a winning position turn into a loser.

##### 4.1 Selling into Strength

The default discipline is to sell a stock as its price is rising and after it has appreciated significantly. For example, after a 100% gain, the impulse is to sell and lock in the profit. This is driven by a desire to secure the return and redeploy the capital into a new, undervalued opportunity. It also serves as an emotional defense mechanism; it is painful to watch a stock double in value only to fall back to the original purchase price.

##### 4.2 Detachment from "What Might Have Been"

A crucial element of the sell discipline is to not regret a sale, even if the stock continues to appreciate substantially afterward. Once a satisfactory profit has been made and the stock is sold, the focus must immediately shift to finding the next undervalued opportunity. Dwelling on what could have been is an emotional trap that serves no purpose. The job is to make a good profit and move on.The final pillar of this philosophy extends beyond financial metrics and into the ethical contract that underpins the entire enterprise.

#### 5.0 Guiding Principles for Partnership

Successful long-term investing is as much a matter of character and trust as it is of financial analysis. This philosophy is governed by a strict ethical framework that defines the management of the fund and its relationship with its investment partners. It is a recognition that managing other people's money is a profound responsibility.

##### 5.1 Fiduciary Responsibility and Trust

There is a profound sense of responsibility that comes with managing capital for others. This duty informs a key operational policy: the portfolio's specific holdings are not disclosed to limited partners. This policy serves two critical functions:

1. It prevents partners from buying the same stocks, which would create unnecessary competition for shares.  
2. It insulates the investment process from the partners' own emotional reactions, preventing them from making calls about specific positions they may dislike.This approach preserves the fund's operational independence and its commitment to an unemotional, data-driven strategy. Consequently, it requires partners who place their fundamental trust not in individual stock picks, but in the manager and the integrity of the investment process itself.

##### 5.2 The Non-Negotiable Importance of Integrity

Over a 50-year career, the single most important lesson learned is the paramount importance of character. It is the bedrock of all successful, long-term relationships, both in business and in life."Honesty is the best thing you can have. It can solve many problems."This belief translates into an unequivocal commitment to dealing only with ethical, moral individuals. Any person who seeks to take advantage of others, regardless of their financial acumen, must be avoided. Character is the ultimate currency.

#### Conclusion: The Enduring Power of Simplicity, Patience, and Discipline

The extraordinary long-term results of this investment philosophy were not achieved through complexity, esoteric financial models, insider information, or an ability to time the market. Success was the direct result of the unwavering and disciplined application of a few simple, powerful principles: buy undervalued companies with low debt, build in a margin of safety, control your emotions and act rationally when others are fearful, remain patient, and, above all, always act with integrity. This approach stands as enduring proof that in the complex arena of investing, unwavering commitment to a few simple, powerful truths—the hard-won distillation of market wisdom—is the most certain path to extraordinary, long-term success.
