# **The Architect of Compounding: A Forensic Analysis of Ted Weschler’s $264 Million Retirement Strategy**

## **Executive Summary**

The accumulation of $264.4 million in a retirement account by a single individual represents a statistical and financial anomaly that demands rigorous forensic explanation. This figure, attributed to Berkshire Hathaway investment manager Ted Weschler by a ProPublica investigation, is not the result of founding a technology unicorn, receiving pre-IPO stock options, or inheriting a dynasty. Instead, it is the product of a reproducible, albeit exceptionally executed, strategy utilizing publicly traded securities within the confines of standard American retirement vehicles.  
This report reconstructs the thirty-year investment odyssey of Ted Weschler. It analyzes how a junior financial analyst converted a $70,000 nest egg in 1989 into a quarter-billion-dollar fortune by 2018\. The analysis identifies three distinct phases of wealth creation: the "Accumulation Phase" (utilizing employer matches and extreme savings rates), the "Hyper-Compounding Phase" (leveraging concentrated value bets in a self-directed IRA), and the "Tax-Efficiency Phase" (executing a strategic Roth conversion).  
Central to this narrative is Weschler’s investment philosophy, which blends the deep due diligence of private equity with the liquidity of public markets. By dissecting his specific investments in distressed entities like W.R. Grace, Cogent Communications, and Valassis Communications, this report illustrates how Weschler exploited market inefficiencies surrounding bankruptcy, debt covenants, and industry consolidation. Furthermore, it examines the "unmonetized lessons" of his early failures, specifically a 52% portfolio drawdown in 1990, which served as a crucible for his risk management framework.  
The report concludes with an assessment of the broader implications for tax policy and individual investors, synthesizing Weschler’s own commentary on the "Lord of the Roths" debate and his prescriptive advice for retirement savers.

## **Part I: The Genesis of a Fortune (1962–1989)**

### **1.1 The Formative Years and Academic Grounding**

Ted Weschler was born on May 16, 1962, in Buffalo, New York, and spent his formative years in Erie, Pennsylvania. His upbringing was rooted in the pragmatic commercial realities of the American Rust Belt. His father served as an executive for the A\&P (The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company), one of the most dominant retail chains of the 20th century. This familial environment likely provided Weschler with an early, osmotic exposure to the mechanics of retail margins, inventory turnover, corporate hierarchy, and the lifecycle of great businesses—A\&P itself being a case study in the rise and eventual stagnation of a market leader.  
Weschler pursued higher education at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, graduating in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science in Economics. His academic concentration in finance and accounting was pivotal. Unlike a general business degree, this specialized focus equipped him with the forensic accounting skills necessary to navigate complex balance sheets and bankruptcy filings. At Wharton, Weschler would have been immersed in the efficient market hypothesis and modern portfolio theory, yet his later career would be defined by exploiting the very inefficiencies those theories claim do not exist.

### **1.2 W.R. Grace and the "Simple Habit"**

Upon graduation in 1983, Weschler did not immediately launch a fund or join a high-flying investment bank. Instead, he joined W.R. Grace & Co., a multinational chemical conglomerate based in New York City, as a junior financial analyst. His starting salary was approximately $22,000 per year.  
It was during his tenure at W.R. Grace (1983–1989) that Weschler engaged in the "simple habit" that would seed his fortune. He maximized his contributions to his employer-sponsored retirement plan. In the mid-1980s, the contribution limits were significantly lower than today (often capped around $2,000 for IRAs), but W.R. Grace offered a generous employer matching program. The mechanics of this period were defined by three critical factors:

1. **Maximum Contribution Rate:** Despite the high cost of living in New York City on a junior analyst's salary, Weschler prioritized saving the maximum allowable amount. This required a lifestyle of deferred consumption, a trait he later cited as an "aspirational example" of the power of saving.  
2. **Employer Match Arbitrage:** The employer match represented an immediate, risk-free return on capital (often 50% or 100% on the first tier of contributions). Weschler recognized that failing to capture the match was mathematically equivalent to rejecting a salary increase.  
3. **The 1980s Bull Market:** Weschler’s accumulation phase coincided with the onset of the great bull market of the 1980s. While his contributions were the primary driver, the tailwinds of falling interest rates and rising equity valuations provided an initial boost to the principal.

By 1989, when he left W.R. Grace to pursue a career in private equity, his retirement account balance had grown to **$70,385**.  
This sum is the mathematical cornerstone of the entire case study. While $70,000 may appear modest, in 1989 dollars it represented a significant capital base for a 27-year-old—roughly equivalent to $170,000 in 2024 purchasing power. More importantly, because this capital was housed within a tax-advantaged account, it could compound without the friction of capital gains taxes, a factor that would amplify his returns over the subsequent three decades.

### **1.3 The Transition to Self-Directed Investing**

In 1989, upon leaving W.R. Grace, Weschler made a critical administrative move: he rolled his employer-sponsored plan into a **Self-Directed IRA**. This decision marked the transition from passive accumulation to active management.  
Unlike standard IRAs held at large brokerages which often limit investors to a menu of mutual funds or ETFs, a Self-Directed IRA grants the holder the freedom to invest in a broader array of assets, including individual stocks, bonds, and even distressed debt. This structure allowed Weschler to apply his growing expertise in stock selection directly to his retirement capital, removing the drag of mutual fund management fees and the dilution of over-diversification. It was the moment Weschler took full control of the "snowball" at the top of the hill.

## **Part II: The Wilderness Years and the First Fire (1990–1999)**

### **2.1 The 52% Drawdown: The Crucible of 1990**

The transition to active management was baptized by fire. In 1990, Weschler’s first full year managing the capital, his portfolio suffered a catastrophic **52% decline**. The account value plummeted from roughly $70,000 to approximately $33,000.  
Forensic analysis of this period identifies the specific culprits of this destruction, revealing that Weschler was not immune to the errors of youth:

1. **Continental Health Affiliates:** Weschler had taken a significant position in this healthcare stock. The investment thesis collapsed, and the stock fell 67% from his cost basis.  
2. **Intelogic Trace:** Weschler invested in the bonds of this computer maintenance company. The position declined by 55%.

This drawdown is a critical psychological inflection point in Weschler’s biography. For the average investor, losing half of one's life savings in a single year typically results in capitulation—selling at the bottom and retreating to low-yield safety to preserve what remains. Such a reaction crystallizes the loss and precludes future recovery.  
Weschler, however, viewed the loss through a stoic, analytical lens. He famously referred to this event not as a financial disaster but as an **"unmonetized lesson"**. He concluded that his error was not in taking risk, but in the *nature* of the risk he took. He had likely relied too heavily on superficial metrics or "story stocks" rather than the deep, fundamental credit analysis that would define his later career. He did not liquidate. He held the remaining capital and refined his process, viewing the remaining $33,000 not as a remnant of failure, but as the seed capital for his next phase.

### **2.2 Quad-C Management: The Private Equity Education**

Concurrent with his IRA management, Weschler co-founded **Quad-C Management** in 1989, a private equity firm based in Charlottesville, Virginia. His decade at Quad-C (1989–1999) served as a practical MBA in business operations, far more valuable than any classroom instruction.  
Private equity investing differs fundamentally from public market trading. In the public markets, liquidity is abundant; if a company misses earnings or the chart looks bad, an investor can sell instantly. In private equity:

* **Liquidity is nonexistent:** You cannot sell if the news is bad. You are married to the investment for 5-7 years.  
* **Control is paramount:** You influence management, strategy, and capital allocation.  
* **Due diligence is exhaustive:** You do not just read the annual report; you audit the inventory, interview customers, analyze the supply chain, and deconstruct the unit economics.

Weschler began applying this "private equity mindset" to his public market IRA. He stopped viewing stocks as electronic tickers that moved up and down and began viewing them as fractional ownership interests in real businesses. He sought companies where he could understand the business with the intimacy of an owner, yet buy them at the discount often available in the public markets during times of distress. This shift from "trading tickers" to "owning businesses" set the stage for the explosive growth that would follow.

## **Part III: The Peninsula Capital Masterclass (2000–2011)**

In 2000, Weschler struck out on his own, founding **Peninsula Capital Advisors**. This hedge fund would become the vehicle for his professional track record, but he ran his personal IRA alongside it, likely mirroring his highest-conviction ideas in his tax-advantaged account.  
The performance of Peninsula Capital is the best proxy for understanding the growth of his IRA during this period. From 2000 to 2011, a period where the S\&P 500 generated a total return of essentially **0%** (the "Lost Decade" bookended by the Dot-com crash and the Great Financial Crisis), Peninsula Capital returned a cumulative **1,236%**. This represents an annualized return of approximately 26%, a figure that places Weschler in the top tier of investors globally.  
This outperformance was driven by a strategy of **extreme concentration**. Weschler rejected the dogma of diversification. Peninsula Capital typically held only a handful of stocks—often 9 to 15 positions—with the top few holdings accounting for 50% to 70% of the portfolio. This high-conviction approach allowed "home run" investments to exponentially increase the account value without being diluted by dozens of mediocre positions.

### **3.1 Deep Dive Case Study: W.R. Grace (The Bankruptcy Arbitrage)**

Weschler’s investment in **W.R. Grace (GRA)** is the archetype of his strategy and likely the single biggest contributor to his early wealth acceleration.  
**The Context:** In 2001, W.R. Grace, Weschler's former employer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The filing was not due to business failure but due to roughly 100,000 asbestos-related injury claims stemming from legacy operations. The stock collapsed, trading as low as $1.31 in October 2001\. The market consensus was that the equity was worthless; in most Chapter 11 cases, the equity holders are wiped out, and the creditors take ownership of the company. Wall Street analysts dropped coverage, and institutional investors fled.  
**The Thesis:** Weschler possessed an information advantage. Having worked as the assistant to the CEO years prior, he understood the underlying quality of Grace’s specialty chemical assets—specifically its catalysts and silica products divisions, which were high-margin cash cows. More importantly, Weschler performed a forensic analysis of the bankruptcy code, specifically **Section 524(g)**. This section allows companies to channel asbestos liabilities into a trust fund, effectively ring-fencing the liability and allowing the core business to emerge cleansed.  
Weschler calculated that the value of Grace’s assets and its future cash flows exceeded the present value of the asbestos claims and other debts. Therefore, the equity was not zero; it was a "stub" with massive upside leverage. He estimated the intrinsic value of the business "without the asbestos taint" was closer to $24 per share.  
**The Execution:** Peninsula Capital bought over 10 million shares, becoming a major shareholder. Weschler didn't just buy; he became active, serving as the Chair of the Equity Committee to protect shareholder interests during the restructuring negotiations. He held the stock for nearly a decade as the bankruptcy process crawled through the courts.  
**The Payoff:** As the legal fog lifted and the reorganization plan solidified, the stock re-rated to reflect the value of the underlying chemical business. By 2011, GRA stock traded above $33 per share. For Weschler, who had been buying at prices between $1 and $3, this represented an **11-bagger** (1,100% return) on a massive, concentrated position. If Weschler allocated 20% of his IRA to this trade in 2003, that single allocation would have multiplied the entire account value significantly.

### **3.2 Deep Dive Case Study: Cogent Communications (The Post-Bubble Survivor)**

Following the Dot-com crash of 2000, the telecommunications sector was a wasteland. Companies like WorldCom and Global Crossing had spent billions laying fiber optic cables across oceans and continents, only to go bankrupt due to overcapacity and fraud.  
**The Thesis:** Weschler identified **Cogent Communications (CCOI)** as the scavenger of this ecosystem. Cogent’s strategy was not to build new networks but to acquire the distressed fiber assets of bankrupt competitors for pennies on the dollar. Weschler recognized the superior unit economics: while the *builders* of the network went broke servicing the debt used to build it, the *operator* who bought the network cheap would have a structurally lower cost basis. Cogent could offer internet transit at prices no competitor could match and still be profitable.  
**The Trade:** Weschler began accumulating shares of Cogent around 2003, when the stock was trading near $1.00 and the market viewed all telecom stocks as toxic.  
**The Payoff:** As internet traffic surged with the advent of video streaming and Web 2.0, Cogent’s low-cost model allowed it to capture significant market share. The company became a cash flow machine. By 2011, the stock had risen 13-fold to over $13 per share. This investment demonstrated Weschler’s ability to distinguish between a "broken industry" (telecom construction) and a "profitable survivor" (telecom operation).

### **3.3 Deep Dive Case Study: Valassis Communications (The Coupon Cash Cow)**

In 2008, amidst the Global Financial Crisis, Weschler identified **Valassis Communications**, a company that printed newspaper coupons and direct mail advertisements.  
**The Fear:** The stock had fallen to \~$1-$3 per share. The market narrative was twofold: (1) The "death of print" meant coupons were obsolete, and (2) Valassis had a heavy debt load that would crush it during the credit freeze of 2008\.  
**The Insight:** Weschler ignored the narrative and analyzed the debt covenants. He discovered that Valassis had **Term Loan B** debt that did not mature for seven years and required minimal principal payments in the interim. This meant the immediate bankruptcy risk was a mirage. Furthermore, he understood the counter-cyclical nature of coupons: in a deep recession, consumers become price-sensitive and use *more* coupons, and businesses use direct mail to drive traffic.  
**The Outcome:** Valassis generated massive free cash flow during the recession, which it used to pay down debt and, crucially, to buy back its own deeply discounted stock. By shrinking the share count while stabilizing the business, the value per remaining share exploded. The share price recovered to \~$34 by 2014, a **10x return**. This trade highlighted Weschler’s ability to value "melting ice cubes"—businesses in secular decline that are mispriced relative to their remaining cash flows.

### **3.4 Deep Dive Case Study: DaVita (The Permanent Holding)**

Weschler began investing in **DaVita (DVA)**, a kidney dialysis provider, around 2000-2001. This investment differs from the deep value plays of Grace or Valassis; it was a compounder he held for decades.  
**The Thesis:** Dialysis is a life-sustaining treatment for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Patients must undergo treatment three times a week or they die. The U.S. government, through the Medicare ESRD program, guarantees payment for the vast majority of these patients, creating a secured revenue stream. The industry is a duopoly controlled by DaVita and Fresenius, creating significant barriers to entry and pricing power.  
**The Execution:** Weschler bought into DaVita during a period of management turmoil. He held the stock as new CEO Kent Thiry (famous for his "Three Musketeers" corporate culture) executed a turnaround, streamlined operations, and consolidated the market. Unlike his other investments which he sold after they re-rated, Weschler held DaVita indefinitely. It became a core holding that he carried over into his tenure at Berkshire Hathaway, eventually convincing Warren Buffett to make Berkshire the largest shareholder (owning \~38% of the company).

### **3.5 Deep Dive Case Study: Wilsons The Leather Experts (The Restructuring)**

Weschler’s involvement with **Wilsons Leather** demonstrates his willingness to engage in activism to protect his capital.  
**The Situation:** Wilsons was a mall-based retailer of leather jackets struggling with changing fashion trends and high rent costs in the mid-2000s. The stock was plummeting, and the business was burning cash.  
**The Activism:** Weschler did not just passively hold the stock. He joined the board of directors. From this vantage point, he guided the company through a painful but necessary restructuring. He pushed for the closure of the underperforming mall-based stores and a pivot toward the company's outlet store concept, which had better unit economics.  
**The Exit:** In 2008, Weschler helped engineer the sale of Wilsons' brand and outlet assets to **G-III Apparel Group**. While the stock chart of Wilsons reflects the volatility of a distressed retailer, Weschler’s active involvement ensured a liquidity event that salvaged value for shareholders rather than allowing the company to slide into liquidation.

## **Part IV: The Roth Conversion Singularity (2012)**

By 2012, Weschler’s self-directed IRA had grown from the post-crash low of \~$33,000 to approximately **$131 million**. This exponential growth was the result of the compounding of the "10-baggers" discussed above. At this juncture, Weschler executed a financial maneuver of staggering boldness: a **Roth IRA Conversion**.

### **4.1 The Mechanics and the Cost**

To convert a traditional IRA (pre-tax) to a Roth IRA (post-tax), an investor must declare the entire account balance as taxable income in the year of conversion. This triggers a massive one-time tax bill, but in exchange, all future growth and withdrawals are tax-free.  
**The Tax Bill:** Weschler paid approximately **$28 million** in federal taxes in 2012 to execute this trade. This payment likely had to be made from funds *outside* the IRA to maximize the conversion's efficiency (if you pay the tax from the IRA balance, you reduce the capital available to compound).  
**The Logic of the Bet:** Paying $28 million voluntarily to the IRS seems counterintuitive. However, Weschler’s decision was rooted in a specific view of the future:

1. **Tax Rates:** He likely believed that future tax rates on wealthy individuals would rise. Locking in the 2012 rate was a hedge against future fiscal policy.  
2. **The Horizon:** The mathematical advantage of a Roth conversion increases with the time horizon and the rate of return. Weschler planned to let the capital compound for another 20+ years. If he could continue to generate high returns (e.g., 10-15%), the "tax drag" on a traditional IRA—where the government effectively owns \~35-40% of the account upon withdrawal—would eventually exceed the $28 million upfront cost by an order of magnitude.  
3. **Estate Planning:** Roth IRAs have no Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) during the owner's lifetime and offer highly efficient wealth transfer dynamics to heirs.

### **4.2 The "Lord of the Roths" Revelation**

In June 2021, ProPublica published an investigative report titled "Lord of the Roths," based on leaked IRS data. The report revealed that Weschler’s Roth IRA had reached **$264.4 million** by 2018\. This placed him in a rarefied group of ultra-wealthy individuals using Roths as massive tax shields.  
**The Controversy:** Critics and policy experts argued that the Roth IRA was designed for middle-class Americans (with annual contribution limits of \~$6,000) to save for retirement, not for the ultra-wealthy to shield quarter-billion-dollar fortunes from taxation. The use of the vehicle by billionaires was framed as a distortion of the tax code's intent.  
**Weschler’s Defense:** Unlike other billionaires named in the report (such as Peter Thiel, whose Roth wealth came from "founder shares" of PayPal priced at fractions of a penny), Weschler responded publicly to ProPublica. In a rare statement, he argued:

* **Public Markets Only:** His fortune was built entirely through "careful stock selection, exceptional luck, and a multi-decade time period" using **publicly traded securities** available to any citizen. He did not use private placement arbitrage or undervalued founder stock.  
* **Pre-Payment:** He emphasized the 2012 conversion, effectively arguing that he *did* pay his taxes—$28 million of them—he just paid them early to buy the tax-free status.  
* **Policy Stance:** Surprisingly, Weschler agreed with the critics. He stated: *"I personally do not feel the tax shield afforded me by my IRA is necessarily good tax policy. To this end, I am openly supportive of modifying the benefit afforded to retirement accounts once they exceed a certain threshold"*.

### **4.3 The Mathematical Implication**

The conversion unlocked pure compounding. In a taxable investment account, a 30% gross gain might be reduced to \~20% after capital gains taxes. In a Roth, 30% stays 30%. Over long periods, this difference is geometric.

* From 2012 to 2018, the account grew from $131 million to $264.4 million.  
* This represents a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of roughly **12.4%** over those six years.  
* While this is lower than his Peninsula Capital returns, it reflects the constraints of managing a larger capital base ($130M+ is harder to move than $1M) and the strict compliance restrictions placed on him after joining Berkshire Hathaway, which limit his ability to trade frequently or front-run Buffett.

## **Part V: The Berkshire Hathaway Era (2012–Present)**

### **5.1 The $5.25 Million Lunch Interviews**

Weschler’s transition to Berkshire Hathaway is a testament to his unconventional approach to career advancement. He did not apply for the job through a recruiter. Instead, he won the annual **GLIDE Foundation** charity auction to have lunch with Warren Buffett—twice.

* **2010:** Weschler bid anonymously and won the lunch for **$2,626,311**. He met Buffett at Piccolo’s in Omaha. Weschler used this meeting to "vet" Buffett, ensuring that the public persona matched the private reality.  
* **2011:** Weschler bid again, winning with a bid of **$2,626,411**.  
* **Total Investment:** **\~$5.25 million**.

While $5.25 million appears to be an exorbitant price for two meals, Weschler viewed it as philanthropy with an embedded option. During these lunches, Buffett realized that Weschler was not just a fan, but a peer. They shared a specific intellectual lineage—both were devotees of the "unmonetized lesson" and the hunt for deep value in distressed situations. By the end of the second lunch, Buffett offered Weschler a position to help manage Berkshire’s investment portfolio, a role Weschler accepted in 2012\.

### **5.2 The "T\&T" Structure: Managing Billions**

At Berkshire, Weschler works alongside Todd Combs (the "T\&T" duo). Together, they manage a combined portfolio that has grown from a few billion dollars initially to over **$30 billion**, operating largely independently of Buffett’s own trades.  
**Weschler’s Influence at Berkshire:**

* **DaVita:** Weschler brought his DaVita thesis to Berkshire. It is now one of the conglomerate's significant holdings, with Berkshire owning roughly 38% of the company.  
* **Tech & Media:** Weschler (along with Combs) is credited with modernizing Berkshire’s portfolio, introducing investments in **DirecTV**, **Liberty Media**, and **Charter Communications**. These picks reflect Weschler’s expertise in subscription models and complex corporate structures.  
* **Structuring:** Weschler is believed to be the architect behind Berkshire’s complex tracking stock arbitrage involving **Liberty Sirius XM**, a trade that required a deep understanding of corporate reorganization—a direct callback to his W.R. Grace analysis.

### **5.3 Recent Activity: The Dillard's (DDS) Trade**

Even while managing billions for Berkshire, Weschler manages his personal capital (the Roth IRA) with the same shark-like instincts. In late 2020, SEC filings revealed that Weschler personally acquired over 5% of **Dillard’s (DDS)**, a department store chain.  
**The Thesis:** Similar to his 2008 Valassis trade, the market had left Dillard's for dead during the COVID-19 pandemic, assuming department stores were obsolete. Weschler recognized that Dillard’s owned its own real estate (low rent expense), had a strong balance sheet, and was managed by a conservative family that bought back stock aggressively.  
**The Outcome:** Dillard’s stock rose from \~$25 in 2020 to over $400 in subsequent years. Weschler exited with a massive gain, proving his knack for "distressed value" intuition remains sharp even two decades after his W.R. Grace trade.

## **Part VI: Synthesis – The Weschler Algorithm**

Weschler’s $264 million fortune is the result of a specific algorithm applied over 35 years. It is not magic, but it is difficult to replicate due to the psychological discipline required.

### **6.1 The Components of Alpha**

1. **Structural Alpha (The Account):** Weschler understood that taxes are the biggest drag on compounding. By using the Roth IRA, he eliminated this friction. A 30% gain in a taxable account is \~20% net. In a Roth, it is 30%. Over 30 years, that difference is hundreds of millions of dollars.  
2. **Psychological Alpha (The Stomach):** The ability to endure a 52% drawdown (1990) without quitting. The ability to buy aggressively during a 50% market crash (2008). Weschler ran *toward* the fire in 2001 (Grace) and 2008 (Valassis) when everyone else was running away.  
3. **Analytical Alpha (The Brain):** The ability to read bankruptcy filings, credit agreements, and legal statutes (Section 524(g)) better than the market. He found value in "ugly" places: asbestos, dialysis, junk mail, and plumbing.

### **6.2 Recommendations for the Aspiring Investor**

In his rare public comments, Weschler distills his advice down to principles that are surprisingly accessible, even if his results are not:

* **Start Early:** The time value of money is the most powerful force. The "snowball" needs a long hill.  
* **Equities are King:** Invest 100% in equities for long horizons. Bonds cannot generate the necessary compounding to turn thousands into millions.  
* **Ignore the Noise:** Daily price fluctuations are irrelevant to intrinsic value. A 50% drop is an opportunity, not a signal to sell.  
* **Index Funds for Most:** Crucially, Weschler explicitly states that for those unwilling to read 10-Ks for 60 hours a week, the **S\&P 500 index** is the correct vehicle. He notes that his $70k would have still grown to roughly **$1.6 million** if invested purely in the S\&P 500—a respectable retirement, if not a billionaire’s fortune.

## **Conclusion**

Ted Weschler’s story is a vindication of the active value investing philosophy. It demonstrates that markets are not perfectly efficient; they panic, they misprice risk, and they ignore complex situations like bankruptcy proceedings. However, it also highlights the immense structural advantages available in the U.S. tax code for those who have the capital and the foresight to use them.  
By combining the intellectual rigor to identify mispriced assets with the structural power of the Roth IRA, Weschler achieved a financial result that borders on the impossible. His journey from a $22,000 salary to a $264 million retirement account stands as the ultimate case study in the power of patience, concentration, and the "simple habit" of saving.

### **Table 1: Weschler's "10-Bagger" Hall of Fame**
