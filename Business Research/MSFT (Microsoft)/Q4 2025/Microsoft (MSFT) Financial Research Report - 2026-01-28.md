## **Latest Quarter Earnings Summary**

Microsoft’s latest earnings (Fiscal Q2 2026, quarter ended December 31, 2025\) beat expectations across the board. Revenue reached **$81.27 billion**, up \~15% year-on-year, driven by cloud services. **Microsoft Cloud** revenue exceeded $50 billion in a quarter for the first time. Operating income grew 23% (non-GAAP) and **diluted EPS was $5.16 GAAP**, up 60% year-over-year (boosted by investment gains related to OpenAI). Excluding that one-time OpenAI gain, adjusted EPS was $4.14 (up 24%). By segment, **Productivity and Business Processes** revenue was $34.1B (↑16%), **Intelligent Cloud** $32.9B (↑29%), and **More Personal Computing** $14.3B (↓3% due to softer Xbox content sales). Notably, **Azure**and other cloud services grew 39%. Microsoft returned **$12.7B** to shareholders in Q2 through dividends and buybacks (↑32% YoY). Overall, the quarter showcased robust cloud and AI-driven growth, with CEO Satya Nadella highlighting that Microsoft has “built an AI business that is larger than some of our biggest franchises”.

## **Business Model**

**Operations & Segments:** Microsoft is a diversified technology company with three main business segments:

* **Productivity & Business Processes:** Encompasses Microsoft 365 (Office) cloud services, LinkedIn, and Dynamics business software.  
* **Intelligent Cloud:** Includes Azure public cloud, server products (Windows Server, SQL Server, GitHub, etc.), and enterprise services.  
* **More Personal Computing:** Includes Windows OS, Surface devices, Xbox gaming, and search advertising (Bing).

**Revenue Streams:** Microsoft generates income from a mix of software licensing, cloud subscriptions, hardware, gaming content, and ads. For fiscal 2025, total revenue was **$281.7 billion** . The largest contributors were cloud and productivity services. Specifically, \~**37.7%** came from Intelligent Cloud, \~**42.9%** from Productivity & Business Processes, and \~**19.4%** from More Personal Computing. Within these segments, key products like Azure (server/cloud) brought in \~$98.4B, Microsoft 365 commercial \~$87.8B, and Windows & Devices \~$17.3B in FY2025. The chart below illustrates Microsoft’s FY2025 revenue breakdown by segment (Intelligent Cloud, Productivity, Personal Computing):

*(Pie Chart: Microsoft FY2025 Revenue by Segment – Intelligent Cloud 37.7%, Productivity & Bus. 42.9%, More Personal Computing 19.4%)*

**Customer Base:** Microsoft’s products reach billions. Over **430 million people** use Microsoft 365 apps and Office 365 has more than **400 million paid seats** (as of FY2024). In the consumer segment, Microsoft 365 has **89 million** individual subscribers. **LinkedIn** counts **1.2 billion members** worldwide . The Xbox ecosystem engages **500 million** monthly active gaming users across platforms . Windows remains ubiquitous with approximately **1.4 billion** active Windows devices globally (combining Windows 10/11). Microsoft’s enterprise reach is unparalleled – **over 95% of Fortune 500**companies use Azure cloud services and similarly high adoption exists for Office 365 and Teams in large organizations. This vast, diversified user base provides Microsoft with multiple revenue streams (subscriptions, licenses, hardware sales, advertising) and a powerful network effect.

**Main Income Sources:** Recurring subscription revenue is a cornerstone. Commercial cloud offerings (Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, etc.) now account for over **$168.9B** annually – more than half of total revenue. Productivity software (Office, Dynamics) and cloud services contribute the largest share, followed by cloud infrastructure (Azure) which alone surpassed **$75B** in FY2025 . Personal computing (Windows OEM licenses, Surface devices, Xbox content) is a smaller but still significant contributor. Microsoft’s revenue mix has shifted toward cloud and subscriptions, providing more stable, repeatable income compared to the one-time software license sales of the past.

**Competitive Moat:** Microsoft enjoys a **wide economic moat** built on several factors: a **dominant brand**, high customer switching costs, a broad enterprise **ecosystem**, and economies of scale. Its Office and Windows franchises are deeply ingrained in business workflows worldwide – companies and consumers rely on these tools daily, making them hard to replace (high switching cost). The **network effect** is strong: the more users and developers on Microsoft’s platforms (Windows, Azure, GitHub), the more valuable they become. Azure, Microsoft 365, Teams, and LinkedIn form a unified cloud platform that reinforces customer lock-in and cross-selling. Additionally, Microsoft’s **scale-driven cost advantages**(huge data centers, R\&D budget \~$24B/year) mean it can outspend smaller competitors in cloud and AI, continuously widening its lead. The trust and familiarity of the Microsoft brand, along with longstanding enterprise relationships (some spanning decades), further solidify its moat. In summary, Microsoft’s business model is fueled by a balanced portfolio of subscription services and software, underpinned by a durable competitive advantage in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure.

## **Headwinds & Risks**

Despite its strengths, Microsoft faces both short-term headwinds and longer-term risks:

**Short-Term/Cyclical Factors:** In the near term, Microsoft could see **temporary slowdowns** due to macroeconomic or industry-specific conditions. For example, a strong U.S. dollar has periodically pressured revenue growth (when overseas earnings are translated) – FX headwinds trimmed a few points off growth in recent quarters. Additionally, **PC market volatility** affects Windows OEM sales; a downturn in PC shipments (as seen during economic slowdowns) can dent the More Personal Computing segment. Similarly, **enterprise IT spending** can be cyclical – if customers tighten budgets during a recession, growth in cloud services or software licenses may decelerate temporarily. We saw modest effects of this in FY2023 when revenue growth dipped to \~7% amid global economic softness. Another short-term risk is **regulatory delays** in acquisitions – for instance, Microsoft’s recent $69B Activision-Blizzard deal faced prolonged antitrust scrutiny, delaying expected benefits. Such regulatory hurdles or geopolitical events could push out growth in certain units (e.g., if cloud services face new foreign regulations).

**Long-Term/Structural Risks:** Over the long run, Microsoft must navigate several strategic challenges:

* **Competition in Cloud & AI:** The cloud infrastructure market is highly competitive, with Amazon AWS and Google Cloud as formidable rivals. Intense price competition or a major shift in cloud technology could pressure Azure’s margins or market share. Similarly, in AI, new entrants or open-source AI models could erode Microsoft’s pricing power in AI services over time. The company’s **gross margins could compress** if it continues massive AI-related capital expenditures (over $120B CapEx planned for AI datacenters) without proportional pricing gains.  
* **Regulatory and Political Risk:** Microsoft operates globally and is not immune to regulatory actions. While it largely escaped the big antitrust cases of the past decade (relative to peers), there is ongoing scrutiny – for example, EU and U.S. regulators examining cloud market practices or app store rules. Potential outcomes could include fines or mandates (though Microsoft’s proactive compliance posture makes drastic action less likely than in the 1990s). Additionally, **data sovereignty laws** (e.g., in Europe or China) might require costly adjustments to cloud operations. There’s also political risk in the sense of U.S.-China relations – Microsoft has a presence in China (LinkedIn until recently, Azure operated via 21Vianet). Geopolitical tensions could limit Microsoft’s access to certain markets or talent pools.  
* **Technology Shifts:** The tech landscape can change quickly – if Microsoft misses a major platform shift, its moat could erode. For instance, the rise of mobile computing saw Microsoft lag behind iOS/Android; it has since refocused on cloud/enterprise, but future shifts (e.g., AR/VR “metaverse” platforms, post-smartphone operating systems) could pose new threats. Open-source software is another perennial risk: free alternatives to Windows, Office, or Azure services (like Linux, LibreOffice, OpenAI models) could gain traction and chip away at Microsoft’s paid offerings, especially if economic pressures push CIOs toward lower-cost solutions.  
* **Execution & Cultural Risks:** As Microsoft grows into a $3+ trillion titan, execution risk grows – integrating large acquisitions (LinkedIn in 2016, Nuance in 2022, Activision in 2023\) tests management’s ability to avoid culture clashes and achieve promised synergies. Missteps in integration could destroy value. Culturally, Microsoft’s successful transformation under Nadella (to a collaborative, cloud-focused culture) must be maintained; any regression or internal turmoil could hamper innovation.

In summary, **short-term headwinds** like currency swings, soft PC demand, and cautious enterprise spending may create quarterly noise, but Microsoft’s diversified revenue base has helped it weather these in the past. **Long-term risks** – chiefly strong competitors, regulatory environments, and tech disruption – require vigilant management. Microsoft’s wide moat and adaptability have so far mitigated these risks, but investors should monitor cloud competition (AWS/Google), global regulations, and Microsoft’s ability to keep leading in the next tech paradigm (AI being the current front).

## **Cost Structure**

Microsoft’s cost structure mixes high fixed costs (R\&D, cloud infrastructure) with variable costs (sales commissions, manufacturing). Key cost components include:

* **Cost of Revenue:** In FY2025, cost of revenue was **$87.8B** (31% of revenue). This covers expenses like data center operations for Azure, hardware production for devices/Xbox, and royalties on Windows OEM sales. As a software/cloud company, Microsoft enjoys high gross margins (\~69% in 2025). However, cloud computing has introduced more cost of revenue (servers, electricity, bandwidth). Notably, Intelligent Cloud’s cost of revenue jumped 36% in one period due to scaling AI infrastructure. **Cost per unit** of software (e.g. an Office 365 seat) is very low – once developed, software can be delivered at near-zero marginal cost. In cloud, after upfront capex, serving additional Azure workloads has declining unit cost at scale. Thus, Microsoft’s **unit economics improve with volume**. For hardware like Surface or Xbox, there is a tangible unit cost (components, assembly). Microsoft often subsidizes Xbox hardware at thin margins (or a loss) to grow the ecosystem, recouping via game sales and subscriptions.  
* **Labor and R\&D:** **Employee compensation** is a significant fixed cost. Microsoft had **228,000 employees** as of mid-2025. About 80,000 in engineering (R\&D), 89,000 in operations/support, and 44,000 in sales & marketing. Annual **Research & Development expense** was $27.2B in 2024 and $30.2B in 2025 (approx.) – around 10% of revenue. These costs (engineer salaries, cloud AI training costs) are largely fixed in the short term. Microsoft invests heavily in R\&D (from cloud AI to gaming) which provides long-term competitive advantage. **Sales and Marketing** expense was $25.2B in 2025 (about 9% of revenue), including marketing campaigns and sales personnel. This includes advertising, which Microsoft can modulate with market conditions (it trimmed S\&M growth to \+5% in 2025). **General & Administrative** is smaller ($5–7B), reflecting headquarters, legal, finance functions.  
* **Capital Expenditures:** Microsoft’s variable costs include significant **capital expenditure (CapEx)** for data centers and hardware. In FY2025, CapEx was around $31.6B (up sharply to support AI cloud demand). While accounted as investments (not operating expense), this is a cash cost. Maintenance CapEx (to keep existing capacity) is lower – likely around Microsoft’s depreciation expense. Depreciation in 2025 was about $15–20B (estimated), implying that amount of CapEx simply maintains current operations, while the rest is growth CapEx. If needed during an economic downturn, Microsoft can **delay expansionary CapEx** to conserve cash (a lever it used in past recessions). For example, in early 2023 Microsoft slowed hiring and took a $1.2B restructuring charge for layoffs, indicating willingness to cut costs in a weaker environment.  
* **Which Costs are Most Significant?** In terms of impact on margins, **cloud infrastructure costs** and **R\&D** are the most significant. Microsoft’s gross profit margin (68.8% in FY25) has drifted slightly downward from historical \~80% levels due to the higher mix of cloud (which has lower margin than pure software). However, gross margin is still very high, indicating costs of revenue are well-controlled. **Operating expenses** (R\&D, S\&M, G\&A) totaled $65.4B in FY25. R\&D and S\&M each make up \~40% of OpEx. Of those, R\&D is crucial for future growth (and Microsoft has been increasing it \~10% YoY, notably in cloud/AI engineering), while S\&M can be more flexibly managed. Labor is a major component across both – Microsoft’s high average salaries (especially for engineers) and stock-based compensation add to fixed costs. **Marketing** spend (ads, promotions) is included in S\&M – for instance, advertising Windows and Surface or promoting Xbox Game Pass. This is variable to some extent; Microsoft can scale back marketing in tough times (as it did by reducing S\&M expense growth in FY2021-2022 when COVID hit, focusing on core sales).  
* **Cost Trends:** Over the past decade, Microsoft’s cost structure has shifted. The company became more **cloud-oriented**, leading to rising cost of revenue and CapEx but also higher recurring revenue. Fixed costs like R\&D have grown in absolute terms (to develop AI, cloud, and hardware), but as a percentage of revenue R\&D has held roughly steady (\~11–13%) due to strong revenue growth. In booming periods (e.g., late 2010s), Microsoft invested aggressively in new cloud regions and AI (CapEx up \~50% in 2023 and 2024). In softer economic conditions, it has shown discipline – for example, pausing hiring and reducing contractor spend in 2020, or the January 2023 layoff of \~10,000 employees to cut operating expense growth. Microsoft’s huge gross margins and cash flow give it flexibility: it can absorb short-term cost increases (like a spike in energy costs for data centers) without jeopardizing profitability. Over time, **economies of scale** and efficiency programs have kept core margins healthy – e.g., Microsoft achieved cloud gross margin improvements through data center optimization even as it scaled Azure. In summary, Microsoft’s cost structure is **highly scalable**: large fixed costs (data centers, software development) support a global customer base, while variable costs (like marketing or support) grow slower than revenue, providing operating leverage in good times and room to trim in downturns.

## **Management & Governance**

**Leadership Team:** Microsoft’s management is widely regarded as one of its strengths, blending long-tenured insiders with experienced outsiders. **Satya Nadella** (CEO & Chairman since 2014\) has led a cultural and strategic transformation toward cloud and AI. He’s a Microsoft veteran (joined 1992\) known for his humble, “learn-it-all” leadership style. Under Nadella, the company’s performance soared – he is often credited with refocusing the company on Azure cloud and subscription services. The **CFO, Amy Hood** (since 2013), is lauded for financial discipline; she joined Microsoft in 2002 and has overseen prudent capital allocation (e.g., balancing big R\&D investments with steady shareholder returns). **Brad Smith** (President and Vice Chair) handles legal, policy and is the public face on regulatory matters; he’s been with Microsoft since 1993\. Other key executives include **Judd Althoff** (Chief Commercial Officer), **Kevin Scott** (CTO, driving AI initiatives), and **Panos Panay** (who led hardware until 2023). The **Board of Directors** has 12 members, 11 of whom are independent. It includes industry leaders like Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder), Hugh Johnston (PepsiCo CFO), Penny Pritzker (former US Commerce Secretary), and Emma Walmsley (CEO of GSK) . The board’s diversity in tech, finance, and public policy provides broad oversight. Notably, **John Thompson** (former Symantec CEO) was lead independent director until 2024, when **Sandra Peterson** (former J\&J executive) took over that role.

**Historical Governance:** Microsoft’s founders – Bill Gates and Paul Allen – are no longer involved in management (Gates stepped off the board in 2020). The company’s leadership history saw only three CEOs in 45 years (Gates, Ballmer, Nadella), providing stability. **Steve Ballmer** (CEO 2000–2014) led during a tough period (missed mobile revolution) but kept revenue growing; however, some investors urged a change late in his tenure (activist ValueAct pushed for new leadership in 2013). Nadella’s tenure has been marked by openness and a growth mindset shift in culture. Management has largely delivered on its strategic promises – e.g., transitioning Office to the cloud (Office 365\) smoothly, growing Azure from niche to a top cloud platform, and making bold bets on AI (OpenAI partnership) that are already bearing fruit. **Credibility with investors is high**: Microsoft consistently meets or beats financial targets and communicates clearly. There have been no major accounting scandals or governance controversies in recent years. In fact, Microsoft is often seen as **shareholder-friendly and transparent**. For instance, Nadella openly addresses challenges (such as when Azure growth slowed a bit in 2019, management was forthright about the reasons and outlook).

**Management Integrity & Track Record:** Independent assessments rate Microsoft’s governance well. The team has not been known to hide problems; issues are usually disclosed in a timely fashion (e.g., when the consumer phone business failed, Microsoft took a $7.6B goodwill write-down in 2015 rather than cover it up). Executives handle analyst questions in earnings calls with solid detail – CFO Hood in particular provides specific segment forecasts and often **“underpromises and overdelivers.”** Over the past decade, management has shown strong capital allocation: high ROE/ROIC (\>20% in recent years) and significant free cash flow generation. They’ve returned cash via steadily rising dividends and opportunistic buybacks, while also funding growth. Nadella has made bold moves (acquisitions of LinkedIn, GitHub, Nuance, Activision) that, so far, appear strategically sound and not overpriced. The board and management have not been subject to meaningful allegations of misconduct. One minor blemish: in 2019, it was revealed Bill Gates had an earlier personal relationship with an employee – the board handled it by review, and Gates left the board, but this did not implicate current management. Overall, no one has **seriously questioned the integrity** of Nadella or his team; they are widely seen as ethical and stakeholder-focused.

**Tenure and Succession:** Many top executives are long-tenured at Microsoft, which provides deep company knowledge. Nadella (29 years at MSFT), Hood (\~20 years), Smith (\~30 years) – this stability has helped maintain Microsoft’s culture. At the same time, they inject new blood where needed (e.g., hiring Kevin Scott from LinkedIn as CTO, bringing in industry veterans to the board). The average tenure of the senior leadership team is over a decade, indicating experience navigating multiple tech cycles. This long-term perspective shows in how they articulate strategy “in decades but execute in quarters”.

**Value Alignment (Skin in the Game):** Microsoft’s leadership is well-aligned with shareholders through stock ownership and incentives. CEO Nadella holds \~896,600 shares of MSFT (worth \~$430 million at current prices), making him a significant individual shareholder. He has periodically sold shares (notably selling \~50% of his stake in 2021 for personal diversification), but still has substantial wealth tied to Microsoft’s stock performance. Other top executives like Amy Hood (567k shares) and Brad Smith (452k shares) also have large holdings. Microsoft’s compensation structure emphasizes stock-based compensation, meaning management’s financial success depends largely on the stock’s long-term value. For example, Nadella’s recent pay packages include multi-year performance stock units that vest only if Microsoft meets ambitious market cap and total shareholder return targets. Management thus has incentive to drive sustainable growth. Historically, Microsoft insiders (like co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Ballmer) were among the largest shareholders; **Steve Ballmer still owns \~4%** of the company (around 333 million shares), making him the biggest individual holder (even larger than Gates now) – Ballmer’s holding, though he’s no longer on the board, underscores insiders’ belief in the company’s long-term prospects. While current executives don’t typically make open-market buys on dips (they mostly rely on granted stock), none have been known to “cash out” in worrying amounts (Nadella’s 2021 sale was notable but he cited tax planning; he retained a significant stake). The fact that leadership’s personal wealth is heavily linked to Microsoft stock performance **aligns their interests with shareholders** – they stand to gain far more from long-term stock appreciation than from short-term bonuses. For instance, Satya Nadella’s stock holdings appreciated by billions as Microsoft’s market cap grew under his tenure, far eclipsing his salary. This alignment incentivizes them to prioritize strategies that build durable shareholder value (like recurring revenue models, prudent M\&A, and returning excess cash to shareholders) over short-term boosts.

In conclusion, Microsoft’s management and governance are a strong point: a stable, experienced team with a track record of smart decision-making and high integrity, whose incentives are tied to shareholders. This gives confidence that the company is in capable hands steering for the long run.

## **Shareholders & Capital Returns**

**Ownership Structure:** Microsoft is one of the most widely held stocks in the world, with a market capitalization around $3.6 trillion. Its shareholder base is dominated by large institutional investors. The top three holders are **Vanguard Group (\~9.4% ownership, \~702 million shares), BlackRock (\~8.0%, \~592 million shares), and State Street (\~4%)**. Together these index-fund giants own over 20% of Microsoft. Another large institutional holder is JPMorgan/Chase with about **4.3%**. In total, institutions hold \~75% of Microsoft’s shares. Among individual shareholders, former CEO **Steve Ballmer**has roughly **4%**, making him likely the single largest individual owner (with an estimated 300+ million shares, valued around $150 billion). Co-founder **Bill Gates** steadily sold shares over the years to fund his philanthropic foundation, and now holds an estimated **1% or less** – although Gates remains Microsoft’s largest founding shareholder, Ballmer has surpassed him in ownership. Current CEO Satya Nadella’s stake (\~0.01%) is smaller by comparison but still significant in value.

**Voting & Activism:** Microsoft’s shareholder voting generally aligns with management’s recommendations, as there are no controlling shareholders – the institutional owners typically vote in accordance with proxy advisor guidance and management’s board recommendations. There hasn’t been a hostile activist campaign since ValueAct Capital’s friendly engagement in 2013 that led to Mason Morfit joining the board and advocating for cloud focus (ValueAct exited by 2017 after stock gains). The top institutional investors (Vanguard, BlackRock, etc.) are largely passive and don’t initiate proposals, but they do exercise voting power on governance and ESG resolutions. **Annual Meeting Votes:** At the 2025 shareholder meeting, all 12 board nominees were re-elected with over 91% support. The advisory vote on executive pay (“say on pay”) passed with a comfortable majority. Shareholders also approved a new stock compensation plan in 2025 (to continue granting employee stock), showing trust in management’s equity usage.

Several **shareholder proposals** are usually on the ballot – often related to social or environmental issues. In 2025, for example, proposals were brought requesting reports on content censorship, human rights due diligence, and climate/AI ethics. None of these passed – support ranged from about **8.7% to 27%** of votes, indicating that at least some large investors did vote for certain ESG proposals (e.g. \~26% voted in favor of a Human Rights Impact report) but not enough for majority. The **largest shareholders typically follow management’s lead** on these proposals; for instance, proxy disclosures show Vanguard and BlackRock often vote with the board’s recommendation unless a proposal addresses a glaring oversight. In 2025, management recommended against those ESG proposals (arguing it already had appropriate transparency), and indeed \>70% of shares voted “No” on each. Notably, one shareholder proposal in 2022 asked Microsoft to report on median pay gaps – Microsoft’s board opposed, and it was rejected (only \~30% support). However, a few years ago a proposal to require a report on sexual harassment policies did receive around 78% support – and Microsoft implemented it, showing responsiveness.

**Key Shareholder Interests:** Large institutional investors mainly care about consistent returns and good governance. So far, Microsoft’s board and management have kept shareholders happy with dividend raises, buybacks, and stock performance. There hasn’t been significant **shareholder activism** or dissident board slates in recent times – a sign that investors are broadly satisfied. Even during the Activision acquisition saga, shareholders were supportive (over 98% of shares voted to approve the deal when put to a vote). The focus topics among top shareholders in recent years have been ESG transparency (which Microsoft has improved via sustainability reports) and responsible AI – Microsoft formed an ethics committee and issues reports, partly in response to investor interest.

**Capital Return Policy:** Microsoft has a **generous capital return program** balanced between dividends and share buybacks. It pays a quarterly dividend (currently $0.75 per share, increasing to $0.82 in Dec 2025), which has been raised annually for over 10 years. In FY2025, Microsoft paid **$24.7 billion in dividends** – a record high. The dividend payout has grown roughly 10% annually in recent years, but the payout ratio remains moderate (\~30% of earnings), giving room for further increases. On share repurchases, Microsoft’s board has authorized large buyback programs periodically. In September 2021, it approved a **$60 billion** repurchase authorization , which was fully utilized by April 2025\. In September 2024, the board approved another **$60 billion buyback program** with no expiration. Over the past 10 years, Microsoft has repurchased substantial stock: for example, it spent **$18.4B on buybacks in FY2025** alone and about $17B in FY2024. Cumulatively, the company returned \~$139B via buybacks from 2015–2024. This has reduced the share count (from \~8.0 billion in 2012 to \~7.5 billion in 2025), providing a tailwind to EPS growth. The current buyback plan ($60B) represents \~1.7% of shares annually at current prices – meaningful but not aggressive, likely aiming to offset dilution from stock compensation and then some.

One should note that Microsoft’s **cash hoard** (over $111B cash & equivalents as of June 2025 ) and strong free cash flow (\~$70–80B/year) enable it to simultaneously invest in growth and return cash. In FY2025, total cash returned to shareholders was $42B ($18.4B buybacks \+ $24B dividends), which was comfortably covered by $ Free Cash Flow ($64B, after capex) – leaving extra cash for acquisitions and cash build. Microsoft’s top shareholders appreciate this balanced approach. None of the big investors have agitated for outsized one-time dividends or similar, since they prefer Microsoft reinvest in high-ROI projects like AI.

**Recent Voting Topics:** In 2025’s annual meeting, notable votes included a proposal related to adherence to human rights in contracts with law enforcement (which got \~12% support) and one on an independent report of government surveillance requests (which got \~23% support). The **top institutional shareholders’ stands** on these are often gleaned from their proxy voting guidelines: for example, BlackRock and Vanguard have indicated they will generally support reasonable shareholder proposals on disclosure if a company lags peers. In Microsoft’s case, since its ESG disclosures are robust, these investors mostly voted with management (against those proposals). On executive pay, about 95% of votes were for Microsoft’s compensation plan in 2025, reflecting confidence in how the board pays management. The **only significant investor dissent** in recent memory was the 2021 say-on-pay where \~5% voted no, some citing a special award to CEO – but it still passed overwhelmingly. Microsoft’s top holders have not exercised votes in an adversarial way – there’s been no effort to vote down directors or split the CEO/Chair role (Nadella holds both, which many large investors are okay with given Microsoft’s performance and presence of a strong Lead Independent Director).

In summary, Microsoft’s shareholder base is stable and supportive. **Passive index funds** are the dominant force, generally voting with management except on certain ESG issues. The **largest individual owners** (Ballmer, Gates) do not have board roles or activist intent, and their selling has been orderly (Gates sells \~20M shares quarterly via a preset plan, Ballmer has not sold significant shares since leaving). Microsoft’s strong financial results and capital return practices have kept shareholders satisfied, avoiding any major proxy fights or activist pressure in the last decade.

※ *Notes:* Market Price is closing stock price on June 30 of each year (or nearest trading day). Book Value/Share is total equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. **ROE** and **ROA** use fiscal year-end net income divided by that year’s equity or assets. **Debt/Equity** is total liabilities divided by total equity (Microsoft carries modest long-term debt and substantial current liabilities from unearned revenue). **Current Ratio** \= current assets / current liabilities. Data sources include Microsoft annual reports and financial filings .

From the table, we see Microsoft’s *tremendous growth* over the decade: Revenue tripled from \~$89B to $282B, and net income quintupled from \~$20.5B to $101.8B. Margins have been consistently strong – net profit margin \~30–36% most years, reflecting Microsoft’s high operating leverage. Notably, the one dip in net income was 2018 due to the one-time tax charge (U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) – excluding that, underlying earnings grew strongly. Return on equity has been extremely high (30–40% in many years), though it declined to \~30% in 2025 as Microsoft’s equity base swelled with retained profits. The company’s balance sheet is very robust (current ratio \~1.8, plenty of liquidity), and while Debt/Equity has risen as it uses some debt financing, it’s still below 1.0 (and interest coverage is massive given the small interest expense relative to EBIT). Free cash flow generation is excellent, averaging \~30% of revenue. Microsoft’s *book value per share* compounded at \~16% annually (from $10 in 2015 to $45 in 2025), with no years of decline – reflecting continuous retained earnings and share buybacks (which boost BVPS by shrinking shares). Overall, the 10-year metrics show a company that has grown rapidly while maintaining stellar profitability and financial strength.

## **Buffett‑Style Checklist**

Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham-style deep value investors often use stringent criteria to identify “great companies at reasonable prices.” Let’s evaluate Microsoft against a selection of such **quality and value standards**:

**1\. Valuation Discipline:**

* **P/E ≤ 15 (vs history):** Microsoft does *not* meet this. Its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is well above 15\. At the January 2026 price \~$480 and FY2025 EPS \~$13.35, the trailing P/E is \~36. Historically, Microsoft’s P/E has ranged from \~25–40 in recent years (it was \<15 only briefly in 2011–2013 when growth stalled). So Microsoft fails the classic P/E ≤15 test – it trades at a premium, reflecting high growth expectations.  
* **PEG \< 1:** The PEG ratio (P/E divided by earnings growth rate) also doesn’t clear the \<1 hurdle. Microsoft’s 5-year EPS CAGR is around 17%, and forward P/E \~30; that yields PEG \~1.8. Even using a one-year pop (21% EPS growth in 2024 ), PEG is \~1.4. So PEG \< 1 (a Peter Lynch benchmark indicating growth at a value price) is not met – Microsoft’s PEG is \>1, signaling it’s not a “growth at reasonable price” by that metric.  
* **P/B ≤ 1.5:** Microsoft fails this by a wide margin. Its price-to-book is about 10.5 (market cap \~$3.59T vs equity \~$343.5B ). Microsoft has always traded above 1.5× book in the past decade, due to its high ROE and intangible assets (brand, software IP) that aren’t fully captured on the balance sheet. While a P/B ≤1.5 might be suitable for asset-heavy firms, for Microsoft (a high-ROE compounder), a low P/B is unlikely unless something is very wrong. So it violates the Graham standard here – but this is expected for a top-tier tech company.  
* **Margin of Safety (Price ≥25% below intrinsic value):** By most valuation models, Microsoft’s stock is not 25% below a conservative intrinsic value – in fact, it’s likely at or above many DCF-based intrinsic values. For instance, a no-growth DCF (discount rate 10%) values Microsoft around $800B (≈ $105/share), and even a generous growth DCF might put intrinsic value around $2.3T (≈ $300/share) (see DCF analysis below). The stock at \~$3.6T is well above these, so there’s no obvious 25% discount. This implies no significant “margin of safety” at current prices. Thus, by strict value criteria, Microsoft is **overvalued** rather than undervalued – its market price assumes continued growth and high profitability, leaving little cushion if things go awry.

**Result:** Microsoft **fails** the classic value investor filters on valuation. Its P/E and P/B are far above conservative cutoffs, and the stock price already reflects a lot of growth (PEG \>1). A deep value purist would consider MSFT overpriced. However, this is common for elite tech franchises – they rarely trade at bargain multiples given their quality.

**2\. Cash Generation & Allocation:**

* **Free Cash Flow positive each year & FCF/Revenue \> 5%:** Microsoft passes this easily. It has been FCF-positive every year for decades. Over the last 10 years, FCF margins ranged \~25–33% (well above the \>5% criterion). Even during 2015–2016 when growth slowed, FCF was robust. In FY2025, FCF was \~$85.7B on $281.7B revenue – about **30.4%** FCF margin, which is six times the 5% threshold. So Microsoft is a cash machine, **PASS** on consistent positive FCF.  
* **Return on Retained Earnings ≥ 12%:** This metric looks at how effectively retained profits are turned into incremental earnings. Microsoft’s performance here is strong. Over 2016–2025, it retained roughly $370B+ of cumulative earnings (after dividends) and increased annual net income by about $81B (from $20.5B to $101.8B). That’s roughly a 22% return on retained earnings – exceeding 12% comfortably. Another approach: from 2015 to 2025, EPS grew from $1.48 to \~$13.35 (adjusted for buybacks) while paying out dividends each year; the compounded ROE and EPS growth imply high returns on what was reinvested. Therefore, Microsoft **passes** this test – management has reinvested earnings at a high rate, evidenced by steep profit growth. (Supporting data: in 2022, net income grew 19% while \~55% of earnings were retained , indicating returns well \>12% on that retention.)

**Result:** Microsoft **passes** the cash generation criteria. It throws off ample free cash, and management has deployed retained capital at well above the 12% hurdle (especially through expansion of the cloud business yielding high ROIC). The company has also used cash for buybacks, which have enhanced EPS growth (suggesting management found buybacks attractive, and indeed retiring shares at higher ROE boosts per-share metrics). From a Buffett perspective, Microsoft’s ability to generate and effectively use cash is top-tier.

**3\. Growth & Predictability:**

* **EPS Record – Positive & rising each year for 10 years:** Microsoft’s **earnings per share (EPS)** trajectory has been positive but not strictly rising every single year – it faltered in 2018 due to an accounting charge. Excluding that anomaly, EPS has risen strongly. For instance, EPS (diluted) was \~$2.79 in FY2016 and grew to \~$13.35 in FY2025. The only dip was FY2018 when GAAP EPS dropped because of the one-time tax charge (EPS fell to $2.13 from $3.31 prior year). Adjusted for that, underlying EPS did grow. After 2018, EPS resumed climbing every year. So while **GAAP EPS was not up literally every year** (failed the “no single year of decline” rule due to 2018), the cause was an extraordinary item. In spirit, Microsoft’s earnings trend is steadily upward – but strictly speaking, it **fails** the “every year higher” test. Graham/Buffett purists might disqualify it for that dip.  
* **Book Value per Share 10-year CAGR ≥ 10%, no year of decline:** Microsoft passes this with flying colors. BVPS grew at \~16% CAGR (from \~$10 in 2015 to \~$45 in 2025). There were *no years of contraction in book value per share.* Even in 2018 when net income was low, book value still increased (the tax charge reduced equity a bit, but ongoing profits and buybacks offset so that BVPS was flat-to-up). According to the data, total equity did dip slightly in 2018 (from $87.0B to $82.7B) due to the tax law impact on deferred taxes, but because Microsoft was buying back shares, BVPS likely held up. Overall, the trend was strongly upward – equity quadrupled in 10 years, and share count shrank \~20%, boosting BVPS consistently. This **passes** the criterion, modulo one minor blip: FY2018’s total equity fell \~5% (so if one is strict, that’s a single year contraction in book value, failing the “no decline” rule at total equity level). But on a per-share basis, BVPS in 2018 was essentially flat because share buybacks cushioned it. Given the substantial growth and only technical decline, Microsoft’s book value performance is excellent.  
* **Owner’s Earnings positive every year & OE/Market Cap ≥ 10%:** *Owner’s earnings* (Buffett’s term roughly \= FCF after maintenance) has been positive each year – in line with FCF being positive. Microsoft’s owner’s earnings margin \~30% means it easily covers this qualitatively. However, **OE/Market Cap ≥ 10%** is not met. At \~$3.6T market cap, 10% would be $360B. Microsoft’s owner’s earnings (essentially FCF) \~ $85B is only \~2.4% of market cap. Even adding back growth CapEx doesn’t get anywhere close to 10%. Microsoft’s earnings yield is around 2.8% (Earnings \~$102B on $3.59T). This is far below 10%. So by that standard (which seeks an earnings yield \> 10% for deep value), Microsoft **fails**. In truth, very few mega-cap quality companies trade with a 10% earnings yield in today’s market – such a high yield would imply a very low P/E \~10. Microsoft’s \~2.8% earnings yield corresponds to a P/E \~36, reflecting investors are paying a premium for its quality/growth. So while owner’s earnings are healthy in absolute terms, relative to price they’re not at a deep-value bargain level.

**Result:** Mixed. Microsoft’s growth track record is stellar overall (aside from one accounting-driven EPS dip). Book value/share growth solidly exceeds 10% CAGR with minimal hiccups. It **passes** the predictability/growth test except for the strictest interpretation of “no EPS down year” (2018). However, its *price* is too high to yield a ≥10% owner earnings yield, thus **failing** that value test. This indicates Microsoft is a great company but not a cheap stock (as Buffett might say, “wonderful company at not-so-wonderful price”).

**4\. Balance-Sheet Safety:**

* **Debt-to-Equity \< 0.5:** Microsoft’s debt ratio is borderline/high by this measure. At FY2025, total liabilities were $275.5B vs equity $343.5B , making debt (liabilities) to equity 0.80. Even excluding deferred revenue and focusing just on interest-bearing debt ($66B debt vs $343B equity), that’s \~0.19, which passes. But classic D/E usually counts all liabilities. Microsoft’s D/E of \~0.8 **fails** the \<0.5 test. However, much of Microsoft’s liabilities are *operational* (unearned revenue, accounts payable) rather than debt. Its net debt is actually negative (more cash than debt). So while formally D/E\>0.5, in practical terms Microsoft’s balance sheet is very strong – it carries \~$112B in cash against \~$50B long-term debt. Many value investors would give Microsoft a pass here due to its huge cash and low net debt. But strictly, on raw D/E, it fails the threshold.  
* **Interest Coverage (EBIT/Interest ≥ 3×):** Microsoft passes easily. In FY2025, EBIT was $128.5B, and interest expense was about $2.4B . That’s \~**53×** coverage. Even in 2024, EBIT $109B vs interest \~$2.9B – \~37× coverage. This is far above the ≥3× standard, a **PASS**. Microsoft could pay its interest hundreds of times over – there’s no concern about interest burden.  
* **Interest Expense / Operating Income ≤ 15%:** This is essentially the inverse of coverage (\~15% corresponds to \~6.7× coverage). Microsoft’s interest expense is only \~1.8% of operating income in 2025 – a **pass**. It’s extremely low, reflecting little debt usage.  
* **Current Ratio \> 1.5:** Microsoft’s liquidity is strong. As of June 2025, current assets were \~$233B vs current liabilities \~$129B (current ratio \~1.8) . It has consistently been above 1.5. Even during years of big acquisitions, Microsoft maintained ample current assets. For instance, in 2022 current ratio was \~1.99, in 2023 \~1.78 (dipped but still \>1.5) as it had large short-term debt for Activision financing which was then paid off. Overall, **PASS** – Microsoft easily meets the liquidity test.

**Result:** Mostly passes. Microsoft’s balance sheet is fortress-like: lots of cash, manageable debt. The only knock is a formal D/E above 0.5 due to large non-debt liabilities (like deferred revenue). But considering **net debt is negative** and interest coverage is over 50x, the company is extremely financially safe. A Graham-style investor concerned with avoiding over-leverage would be comfortable with Microsoft’s balance sheet.

**5\. Profitability & Efficiency:**

* **Gross Margin ≳ 40%:** Microsoft’s gross margins are about 65–69% in recent years – well above 40%. This indicates strong pricing power and product differentiation. Even as the product mix shifted to more cloud hardware, gross margin stayed far above the threshold. **PASS**.  
* **Net Profit Margin ≳ 20%:** Microsoft consistently posts net margins around 30%. For FY2025, net margin was 36.1%; even in slower years it was \~25–31%. This is *exceptional*, far exceeding 20%. **PASS**. Few companies of Microsoft’s size have such high net margins.  
* **Return on Equity (ROE) ≥ 15% average for 10 yrs:** Microsoft’s ROE has been extremely high, averaging \~30%+ over the decade. Even its lowest ROE year (2018) was \~20% (dampened by the tax charge; excluding that, ROE would have been much higher). Most years, ROE was in the 25–45% range, reflecting very efficient use of equity . The 10-year average ROE is well above 15%. In FY2025, ROE dipped to \~29.6% (because equity ballooned) – still double the threshold. **PASS**. Microsoft generates high profits on each dollar of shareholder equity, a sign of a superb business.  
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) ≥ 12% (10-yr avg):** Microsoft’s ROIC (which considers return on equity \+ debt capital) also comfortably exceeds 12%. Using NOPAT/ (debt+equity), Microsoft’s ROIC in 2025 was roughly: NOPAT \~$109B (EBIT $128.5B less taxes) divided by (Equity $343B \+ Debt \~$50B) ≈ 29%. Historically, ROIC has been in the mid-20s or higher. This is far above 12% each year. **PASS**. (GuruFocus estimates Microsoft’s 10-yr median ROIC around 20%, which is excellent.).  
* **Return on Assets (ROA) ≥ 6%:** Microsoft’s ROA is strong, reflecting its asset-light software model. In 2025, ROA was \~16.4% ($101.8B net / $619B assets) . Even after massive asset growth (due to cash buildup and goodwill from acquisitions), ROA remained well above 6%. The 10-year average ROA is around 11–15%. **PASS**.  
* **Depreciation / Gross Profit ≤ 10%:** This checks whether the business is capital intensive. Microsoft’s depreciation expense in 2025 was about $16B (estimated from cash flow), which is \~8% of $193.9B gross profit – under 10%. It has risen with cloud build-out, but still within the threshold. Historically, depreciation has been less than 10% of gross profit every year (e.g., \~5% a decade ago, rising to high single digits now). **PASS**. This indicates that although cloud infrastructure requires capex, Microsoft’s core business remains less capital-intensive relative to the gross profit it generates.

**Result:** Microsoft **passes all profitability criteria** handily. Its margins and returns on capital are well above the benchmarks. These metrics paint Microsoft as a highly efficient, cash-generative enterprise – precisely the kind of quality business Buffett likes *except* usually he’d prefer a lower price.

**Summary:** By the Buffett-style checklist, Microsoft exhibits **excellent business quality** (high margins, high returns on capital, consistent growth, strong balance sheet) but **fails on the strict valuation metrics** (it’s not cheap by P/E, PEG, or earnings yield standards). A deep value investor might say Microsoft is a “wonderful company at a high price.” It does not offer the margin of safety in price that classic Graham criteria demand. However, its superb financial performance meets or exceeds nearly all the quality thresholds (aside from a one-off EPS dip and a formal D/E ratio quibble). Whether it’s a buy depends on one’s willingness to pay up for quality. Traditional value standards would likely categorize Microsoft as *overvalued* currently, despite its great fundamentals, so a Graham disciple might put it on the watchlist and wait for a significant price drop to consider it within the “buy” zone.

## **DCF Valuation (Intrinsic Value Estimate)**

To assess Microsoft’s intrinsic value, we perform a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** analysis under three scenarios: **No-Growth**, **Conservative Growth**, and **Nominal Growth**. We use Microsoft’s **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** as the basis (since FCF represents owners’ earnings available to shareholders). Microsoft’s FCF over the last 12 months (FY2025) was approximately **$85.7 billion** (Net cash from operations of $106B minus capital expenditures of \~$20.3B). We will assume a **discount rate** of 10% (Microsoft’s approximate cost of equity, reflecting the return a long-term stock investor might require).

**Case 1: No-Growth Scenario** – *“Steady State”*

In this scenario, we assume Microsoft’s FCF will **stay flat at $85.7B per year indefinitely**, with zero growth and no decline (a very conservative outlook given Microsoft’s historical growth). Essentially, Microsoft would just maintain current earnings forever. The DCF for a perpetuity with no growth is: Intrinsic Value \= FCF / Discount Rate. Plugging in the numbers:

\\text{Value}\_{\\text{no-growth}} \= \\frac{85.7}{0.10} \= \\$857 \\text{ billion}.

This equates to about **$112 per share** (using \~7.65B shares outstanding). To then incorporate a *margin of safety* of 30%, a prudent buy price in this no-growth scenario would be 0.7 × 857 \= **$600B**, or roughly **$80/share**.

Interpretation: If you believed Microsoft will never grow again and just churn out \~$85B FCF annually, it would be worth about $857B. Microsoft’s actual market cap is \~$3.59 trillion, far above this – meaning the market is pricing in substantial growth. So by this no-growth DCF, Microsoft is *overvalued*. For it to trade at $857B, the stock would have to fall to around $112 (an unlikely scenario barring a huge earnings collapse). In fact, Microsoft’s current price around $480 implies the market anticipates a lot of growth ahead (which is reasonable given its recent \~15% revenue growth). The no-growth DCF thus provides a lower bound. Microsoft’s high return on capital and dominant position make a zero-growth future very improbable – but it highlights that much of its valuation is based on expected growth, not just existing cash flows.

**Case 2: Conservative Growth Scenario** – *“Low Growth”*

Here we use the **lowest FCF growth rate Microsoft has experienced in the past decade** as the future growth rate. Microsoft’s lowest revenue growth was \~0.9% in 2016, and lowest EPS growth was negative in 2018 (due to the one-time charge). But focusing on a sustainable low growth, let’s pick a modest **3% annual FCF growth** (roughly equal to long-term inflation). This is conservative given Microsoft grew FCF \~15% CAGR over the last 5 years. We’ll assume this 3% growth for the next 10 years, then zero growth beyond (terminal growth 0%).

**Basis:** 3% is a *conservative floor* – even if Azure decelerated and Windows stagnated, Microsoft might still eke out low-single-digit growth through pricing or inflation. It’s also similar to the lowest revenue growth years adjusting for currency. (If one took “lowest past 10-year FCF growth” literally, some years FCF jumped or dipped with working capital, but 3% seems a fair low steady rate.)

**DCF Calculation:** We project FCF starting at $85.7B and growing 3% annually for 10 years, then no growth thereafter. Using a 10% discount rate:

* Sum of present value of years 1–10 cash flows \= approximately $85.7B × \[(1.03^t)/(1.10^t)\] summed over t=1 to 10\. (This factor is like 3% growth, 10% discount each year.) This equals about **$731.4B**.  
* Terminal value at end of year 10 \= FCF\_year10 × (1 \+ 0% growth) / (0.10) \= FCF\_year10 / 0.10. FCF in year 10 \= $85.7B × 1.03^10 ≈ $115.2B. Terminal value \= $115.2/0.10 \= **$1,152B**. Present value of that terminal value \= $1,152B / (1.10^10) ≈ $1,152B / 2.593 ≈ **$444.4B**.  
* Adding these: Intrinsic value ≈ $731.4B \+ $444.4B \= **$1.175 trillion**.

Dividing by shares (7.65B) gives \*\*$154 per share\*\* intrinsic value under this low-growth scenario. Applying a 30% margin of safety, a buy target would be \~$108/share.

Microsoft’s current price \~$480 is over 3× this conservative intrinsic value. So even with a small positive growth, the DCF suggests the stock is richly priced. In other words, if Microsoft only grows \~3% going forward, the current stock price is far above what a 10% return investor should pay. This scenario might be analogous to a world where cloud computing saturates and Microsoft’s growth slows to GDP-like levels – in that world, a fair price might be around $150, far below the market price. This indicates the market expects much higher growth than 3%. Indeed, Microsoft’s own recent outlook is for double-digit growth in many segments, not low single digits.

**Case 3: Nominal Growth Scenario** – *“Status Quo/Average”*

Now assume Microsoft grows FCF at roughly its **historical average rate**. In the past 10 years, FCF grew from \~$24.6B in 2016 to \~$85.7B in 2025 – a CAGR of \~15%. But growth has accelerated more recently (FCF up \~25% YoY in 2021, then slowed to mid-single-digit in 2023 due to capex jump). To be slightly cautious, let’s assume **10% annual FCF growth** for the next 10 years, then a terminal growth of 3% thereafter. This represents a “normal” optimistic scenario: Microsoft continues strong growth in cloud & AI for a decade, then matures.

**Basis:** 10% is close to Microsoft’s revenue CAGR expectation (analysts see \~11–12% annually next 5 years). It’s lower than the last 5-year EPS growth (\~17%), building in some moderation. Terminal growth 3% assumes Microsoft can at least grow with global GDP in perpetuity (reasonable given its durable position).

**DCF Calculation:** Starting FCF $85.7B, grow at 10% for 10 years:

* PV of first 10 years of FCF \= $85.7B \* sum\_{t=1}^{10} (1.10^t / 1.10^t) \= $85.7B \* 10 (because growth and discount are same 10%, the cash flows’ present values essentially sum to 10 times the initial value). Actually, exactly: each year’s PV \= $85.7B, since 10% growth cancels 10% discount. So sum \= $85.7B \* 10 \= **$857B**.  
* Terminal FCF in year 11 \= $85.7B \* 1.10^10 ≈ $222B. Terminal value at 3% growth \= $222B \* (1.03) / (0.10-0.03) \= $228.7B / 0.07 ≈ **$3,267B**. Present value of terminal \= $3,267B / (1.10^10) \= $3,267B / 2.593 ≈ **$1,260B**.  
* Total intrinsic value \= $857B \+ $1,260B \= **$2.117 trillion**. That’s about **$277 per share**.

With a 30% margin of safety, a buy price would be \~$194/share or below in this scenario.

Comparing to market: The current market cap \~$3.59T is \~70% higher than this DCF intrinsic value of $2.12T. This implies the market is pricing in even more optimistic growth or lower discount rate. For instance, if we assumed 13–15% growth for 10 years, the DCF value would climb substantially (closer to current market cap). In fact, Microsoft’s share price likely factors in growth in the mid-teens for several years (driven by AI, cloud) and maybe a cost of capital slightly under 10% given low interest rates until recently.

**Summary of DCF Cases:**

* **No Growth:** Value ≈ $857B ($112/share). Implied MOS 30% buy \~$80. Microsoft is far above this – meaning its valuation *requires* growth.  
* **Conservative (Low \~3% growth):** Value ≈ $1.18T ($154/share). 30% MOS buy $108. Again, stock ($480) is well above, implying actual growth should be much higher than 3%.  
* **Nominal (Avg \~10% growth):** Value ≈ $2.12T ($277/share). 30% MOS buy \~$194. Microsoft’s price \~$480 is \~70% above even this optimistic intrinsic value. This indicates the market expects perhaps mid-teens growth for a longer period or considers Microsoft’s risk (discount) to be lower (some might use 8% discount for such stable cash flows, which would boost the DCF significantly).

It appears **Microsoft’s stock is priced for very high growth** – likely around 15%+ FCF growth for a decade or more. If Microsoft can indeed sustain, say, 15% FCF growth for 10 years and then 5% terminal (which might approximate the AI-driven bull case), the intrinsic value would edge closer to the current price. For illustration, if we do 15% growth for 10 yrs, 5% terminal at 10% discount, the value comes out near $3.5T, aligning with market cap. So essentially the market is **betting on sustained double-digit growth** fueled by Azure’s expansion, AI services (like new Copilot subscriptions), and continued monetization of its massive user base.

For a value investor demanding a margin of safety, Microsoft does *not* offer an obvious bargain. Its current valuation leaves little room for error – any slowdown in growth or compression of margins could result in returns below the 10% hurdle. However, one might argue Microsoft deserves a premium because of its exceptional quality and competitive moat (and perhaps one could use a 8–9% discount rate reflecting its lower risk, which would raise DCF values by \~25–35%). Even so, at $480/share, Microsoft’s **margin of safety is essentially zero** under typical assumptions – the stock is pricing in best-case outcomes.

**DCF Conclusion:** Using a standard 10% discount rate, Microsoft’s intrinsic value ranges from \~$112/share (no growth) to \~$277/share (strong 10% growth). All are below the current \~$480. This suggests that *if one insists on a 10% annual return*, buying Microsoft at today’s price may not achieve it unless Microsoft outperforms even these models (e.g., FCF grows in mid-teens or higher, or the investment horizon is willing to accept a lower return). A prudent value investor might set a buy target around $200 or below (which corresponds to expecting 10%+ returns if Microsoft executes well).

In reality, many investors are accepting a lower expected return for Microsoft because of its stability – a 5%–7% expected return might be acceptable to them, given the low interest rate era mentality. But under classic DCF with margin of safety, Microsoft stock looks **overvalued relative to the cash it is likely to produce**. Buffett often says “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Microsoft is a wonderful company – but the DCF suggests the price is *more than fair*, perhaps rich. An investor must believe in substantial growth (AI-driven or otherwise) to justify the current valuation.

*(All figures in USD. These DCF estimates are simplified and based on assumptions – actual outcomes can differ. They illustrate sensitivity of Microsoft’s valuation to growth expectations and reinforce that much of Microsoft’s current value is tied to future growth potential.)*

## **Key Metrics Charts**

To visualize Microsoft’s 10-year trends, below are several charts of key metrics (2016–2025), with 10-year averages and notable points highlighted:

**Revenue & Net Income (2016–2025):** Microsoft’s revenue nearly **tripled** from $89B in 2016 to $282B in 2025, a CAGR of \~14.5%. Net income grew even faster – from $20.5B to $101.8B (CAGR \~19%). The chart shows a steady upward trajectory, with net income margin widening from \~23% to 36%. The only dip in net income occurred in 2018 (orange dot) due to a tax charge, but otherwise profits marched upward. *Average revenue growth (red dashed line) \~15%*. Max revenue growth was 18% (2018, 2022\) and min \~1% (2016). Microsoft’s ability to accelerate growth in the cloud era is evident from 2017 onward.

*(Line Chart: Blue line \= Revenue, Orange line \= Net Income, vertical axis in $ Billions. Red dashed line \= 10-yr average revenue growth \~15%. Notable point: 2018 net income dip due to TCJA.)*

**Profit Margins:** Gross margin (grey area) has held around 65–69% throughout, well above the 40% benchmark (green line). Operating margin (blue line) improved from \~31% in 2016 to \~45.6% in 2025 as the shift to higher-margin cloud and software boosted profitability. Net margin (orange line) likewise expanded from \~23% to 36%. Microsoft’s **average net margin** over 10 years (\~30%, red line) far exceeds typical companies. Depreciation as a % of gross profit (purple line) rose from \~5% to \~8% as cloud investments grew, but remains below the 10% standard (purple dotted line). These consistent high margins highlight Microsoft’s operational efficiency and pricing power over the decade.

*(Line Chart: Gross Margin %, Operating Margin %, Net Margin %, Depreciation/Gross Profit %. Horizontal green line at 40% gross margin benchmark, purple dotted at 10% depreciation/gross profit. Shows Microsoft well above these thresholds continuously.)*

**Return on Equity & Assets:** Microsoft’s ROE (blue columns) was extraordinary especially from 2017–2022, often \>30%. It peaked at \~45% in 2019–2020, then declined to \~29.6% in 2025 as equity base swelled. Still, this vastly beats the 15% benchmark (red line). *10-year average ROE \~34%* (dash). Return on Assets (orange columns) climbed from \~13% to a high of \~16% in 2021, then slightly down to 16.4% in 2025 as total assets grew to $619B. All years are well above the 6% benchmark (green line). Microsoft’s superior returns reflect its low capital intensity and high margins. Even in its “lowest” year (2018, ROE \~20%), it beat 15% easily. The trend is ROE coming down recently only because Microsoft is retaining so much capital (which is a high-class problem).

*(Bar Chart: ROE and ROA by year, with horizontal reference lines at 15% ROE and 6% ROA. Shows every year’s bars above those lines by a wide margin, average ROE \~34% highlighted.)*

**Debt & Liquidity:** Microsoft’s **Debt-to-Equity** ratio (grey area chart) rose from \~0.70 in 2016 to \~0.80 in 2025, exceeding the 0.5 guideline (red line) in all years. However, most of this “debt” is actually operational liabilities; Microsoft’s interest-bearing debt/equity (green line) is much lower (\~0.2 in 2025). The **Current Ratio** (blue line) stayed strong: fluctuating around 2.5 early, dipping to \~1.78 in 2023 (as Activision deal financing temporarily increased current liabilities), then back to \~1.80 in 2025\. It was always above the 1.5 threshold (purple line), indicating ample liquidity. The chart conveys that while Microsoft’s formal D/E looks above the ideal, its cash and current assets well cover obligations – financial stability remained excellent through the decade.

*(Area/Line Chart: Grey area \= total Debt/Equity, green line \= Long-term Debt/Equity, blue line \= Current Ratio. Red horizontal at 0.5 D/E, purple at 1.5 current ratio. Microsoft’s current ratio always above purple, D/E above red but note low long-term debt line.)*

**Valuation Multiples:** Microsoft’s valuation multiples expanded over the decade. The **P/E ratio** (orange line) was \~30 in 2016, dipped to \~25 by 2017, then rose; it spiked above 35 in 2018–2019 as price surged and earnings temporarily dipped, and currently \~36 (as of FY2025). This is well above the ≤15 value benchmark (red line). The **P/B ratio** (blue line) climbed dramatically – from \~5× in 2016 to \~10.5× in 2025, far above the ≤1.5 benchmark (green line). This reflects both price growth and Microsoft’s share repurchases boosting book value per share more slowly than market cap. **PEG ratio**(grey columns) – using forward earnings growth – ranged \~1.5–2.5 most years, exceeding the \<1 ideal (purple line). The chart clearly shows Microsoft’s market valuation outpacing conservative “value” thresholds in recent years. The average P/E \~28 (dashed) is nearly double 15; average P/B \~7.5 is 5× the 1.5 yardstick. This highlights that Microsoft has not been a classic value stock; investors pay a premium for its growth and quality.

*(Line/Column Chart: P/E and P/B lines, PEG ratio columns. Red line at P/E 15, green at P/B 1.5, purple at PEG 1\. Shows MSFT multiples well above lines throughout, especially post-2018.)*

**Conclusion:** The visual trends underscore Microsoft’s transformation into a *growth powerhouse with exceptional profitability*. All quality metrics (margins, ROE/ROA, FCF, coverage ratios) are not just above thresholds but vastly so. The only area where Microsoft “fails” – valuation – is evident in the rising P/E, P/B, and PEG in the charts, reflecting that the market recognizes Microsoft’s excellence and bids it up accordingly. For a deep value investor, these charts validate Microsoft as a **wonderful business**, albeit one that rarely trades at a “wonderful price.”
