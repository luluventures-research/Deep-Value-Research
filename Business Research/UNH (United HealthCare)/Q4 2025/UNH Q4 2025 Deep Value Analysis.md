## **Latest Quarter Earnings Summary**

UnitedHealth Group (UNH) reported **4Q 2025** earnings highlighting robust revenue growth but sharply lower net profit due to one-time charges . **Fourth-quarter 2025 revenue** was about **$113 billion**, contributing to **full-year 2025 revenue of $447.6 billion** – a **12% increase** year-over-year . This growth was driven by expanded membership and service utilization. The **UnitedHealthcare (insurance) division** grew FY2025 sales 16% to **$344.9 billion** as enrollment climbed to **49.8 million consumers** . The **Optum (health services) division** saw 7% higher revenue, reaching **$270.6 billion**, serving over **123 million people** across its OptumHealth, OptumInsight, and OptumRx units . However, UNH’s **4Q 2025 net income was nearly breakeven** at just **$0.01 GAAP EPS** (almost *zero* net profit) due to a large one-time **$1.6 billion after-tax restructuring charge** . Excluding that charge, **adjusted 4Q 2025 EPS** was **$2.11**, bringing full-year 2025 adjusted earnings to **$16.35 per share** . These results were roughly in line with analyst expectations . The charge included costs for a cyberattack, portfolio divestitures, and operational reorganization , which management undertook to enhance transparency and efficiency. As a result, **full-year GAAP net margin fell to 2.7%** in 2025 (from \~6% historically), and operating cash flow was **$19.7 billion (≈1.5× net income)** . Importantly, the company **raised its FY2026 outlook**, forecasting **\>$439 billion revenue** and **\>$17.75 adjusted EPS** . This implies a mid-single-digit revenue decline (due to divested businesses) but a high-single-digit EPS gain, signaling expected margin recovery as one-off costs abate. In summary, 4Q 2025 showed **continued top-line strength** but **compressed profit** from exceptional charges and elevated medical costs, with management taking steps to reset operations for improved performance going forward.

## **Business Model**

**UnitedHealth Group’s Business** spans two complementary platforms:

* **UnitedHealthcare (UHC)** – a health insurance benefits provider, and  
* **Optum** – a health services and technology provider (including OptumHealth care delivery, OptumRx pharmacy benefits, and OptumInsight data/IT services).

**Revenue Streams:** The majority of UNH’s income comes from *insurance premiums*. In fact, risk-based insurance premiums account for about **79% of total revenue** . UHC collects premiums from employers, individuals, and government programs (Medicare/Medicaid) in exchange for covering members’ medical costs. This generates steady cash inflow, albeit with the obligation to pay claims. Optum contributes the remaining \~21% of revenue via fees for health services, pharmacy sales, and consulting/technology contracts . *Investment income* from insurance float and *ancillary products* provide additional income, but are relatively minor. The chart below shows UnitedHealth’s revenue mix and growth over the past decade, illustrating the dominant premium income and the company’s expanding scale: 

*Revenue (营业收入) – UnitedHealth’s total annual revenue has grown consistently, topping $447 billion in 2025 . Insurance premiums (\~79% of revenue) remain the primary source . The red dashed line shows the 10-year average growth (\~11% YoY). 2025 revenue jumped 12%, well above the \~7–8% historical norm, as indicated by the yellow markers for min/max.*

**Customers & Units:** UnitedHealthcare is the nation’s largest insurer, serving **49.8 million health plan members** in 2025 . This includes employers (commercial group plans), individuals, and government program beneficiaries (Medicare Advantage with \~7 million seniors, Medicaid managed care, etc.). On the Optum side, UNH engages an even larger population – over **123 million unique consumers** accessed Optum’s services in 2025 . For example, OptumRx processes over **1 billion prescriptions annually** (making it a top pharmacy benefit manager), and OptumHealth provides care to tens of millions through clinics, surgery centers, and digital care. This enormous customer base (effectively touching \~**150 million+ people** when accounting for overlap ) gives UNH unmatched scale. In terms of units sold: beyond insurance policies, UNH’s volume includes medical services delivered (e.g. doctor visits via OptumHealth), prescriptions filled, and consulting engagements via OptumInsight. Each of these service “units” leverages the broad UHC membership funnel – e.g. many UHC insureds use Optum pharmacies and clinics, creating cross-selling synergy.

**Moat & Competitive Advantages:** UnitedHealth’s **competitive moat is primarily its scale and integration**. As the largest U.S. health insurer, UNH has vast bargaining power with healthcare providers and drugmakers, allowing it to secure favorable rates (lower medical cost) that smaller insurers cannot . Its size also spreads fixed administrative costs over a huge membership, yielding a lower expense ratio. Moreover, UNH’s unique integration of insurance (UHC) with healthcare delivery and analytics (Optum) is a powerful differentiator. By owning both the payer and provider side, UNH can coordinate care more efficiently – for example, using OptumInsight data analytics to manage UHC claims costs, or steering UHC members to OptumHealth clinics for better outcomes and lower expense. This **vertically integrated model**(insurance \+ care \+ pharmacy under one roof) is hard for competitors to replicate at scale. UNH also benefits from high **switching costs** and **network effects**. Large employers choose insurers with broad provider networks; UnitedHealthcare’s network includes \>1.5 million physicians and thousands of hospitals nationwide, the result of decades of contracting. Members are reluctant to leave if it may disrupt access to their doctors. Additionally, UNH’s extensive data (from insuring millions of lives) and technology (OptumInsight’s analytics and AI) create a **data advantage** for underwriting and managing health outcomes. In summary, UNH enjoys a **wide moat** from scale economies, integrated offerings, a vast network, and data/technology, which together help defend its market-leading position and profit margins against both traditional insurers and new tech-driven entrants.

## **Headwinds & Risks**

Like all healthcare companies, UnitedHealth faces **short-term headwinds** that can pressure results, as well as **long-term structural risks** that could alter its growth trajectory:

* **Short-Term / Cyclical Factors:** One recent headwind was the surge in healthcare utilization in 2023–2024 as patients caught up on deferred care from the pandemic. This drove UNH’s medical cost trend above expectations – e.g. more elective surgeries among seniors caused a higher medical loss ratio (claims as % of premiums) . In 2024, UNH’s consolidated medical care ratio jumped \~340 basis points to 88.9% (adjusted) , compressing margins. Such spikes in usage (often cyclical) can temporarily hurt insurer profits until premiums adjust. **Economic conditions**also play a short-term role: in recessions, commercial membership may dip (with job losses reducing employer plan enrollment), partially offset by gains in Medicaid (as more people qualify). For example, the unwinding of pandemic Medicaid expansions in 2023 meant millions lost Medicaid coverage, slowing UNH’s membership growth in that segment. **Inflation** in healthcare costs (e.g. rising hospital wages, drug prices) is another short-term risk if it outpaces premium increases. UNH must price premiums a year in advance; sudden cost inflation can squeeze near-term margins until rates catch up. We saw this in 2022–2023 when labor and supply costs drove up care expenses. **Political/regulatory events** can create temporary turbulence as well. In mid-2025, UnitedHealth shocked markets by **withdrawing its earnings guidance and replacing its CEO** amid concerns over Medicare costs . The abrupt leadership change (Andrew Witty stepping down, Stephen Hemsley returning) and the uncertainty around Medicare payments caused an 8% stock drop , exemplifying how policy news can spur short-term volatility.  
* **Long-Term / Structural Risks:** Over the longer run, the biggest risk is the potential for major U.S. health policy changes. A move toward a **single-payer healthcare system** or “Medicare for All” could fundamentally threaten private insurers. While not imminent, the political debate means this overhang persists. Even incremental reforms pose risk – for instance, the government regularly adjusts Medicare Advantage funding. In fact, UNH expects **Medicare Advantage payment rate changes in 2026 to create a \>$6 billion headwind** to revenue (through risk adjustment formula tweaks). Such cuts, if sustained, could permanently compress margins in that business. **Regulatory scrutiny** is intensifying: a Senate report in late 2025 criticized certain industry practices, raising the chance of stricter rules on prior authorizations or network adequacy . UNH’s integrated model (ownership of providers via Optum) could also invite antitrust attention – regulators might question if owning both payer and provider harms competition. Additionally, **technological disruption** looms as a long-term factor. While UNH is a leader in health IT through OptumInsight, innovations like telehealth, AI diagnostics, or new healthcare delivery entrants (Amazon, etc.) could alter the landscape. UNH must continuously adapt to avoid disintermediation by more nimble tech players. **Demographic trends** are a double-edged sword: an aging population means more demand (tailwind for Medicare plans), but also higher medical costs and reliance on government programs (which face solvency issues, potentially a fiscal headwind) . Lastly, **execution risks** exist – integrating acquisitions (UNH has been acquisitive in expanding Optum) and preventing data breaches (cybersecurity is vital given UNH’s troves of health data – note the $800 million cyberattack cost in 2025 ) are ongoing challenges. In summary, while UNH’s near-term outlook is strong, investors must monitor policy shifts (e.g. Medicare rate cuts), regulatory climate, and disruptive innovation as key long-term risks that could permanently impact the business model.

## **Cost Structure**

UnitedHealth’s costs consist of **variable medical costs** linked to providing healthcare and **fixed operating costs** to run its expansive business:

* **Cost per Unit:** In the insurance segment (UHC), the primary “unit” cost is the medical claim cost per member. For every member insured, UNH incurs medical expenses whenever that person utilizes healthcare. This is captured in the **medical care ratio (MCR)** – currently around 88–89% , meaning \~89 cents of every premium dollar go to pay medical claims. In dollar terms, in 2025 UNH paid out **$396 billion** in medical costs on $447.6 billion premium revenue (an average of \~$8,000 per member). These costs vary with service utilization – more doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescriptions drive costs up. In Optum’s provider clinics and pharmacy services, the “unit” costs include salaries of clinicians per visit and the cost of drugs per prescription. OptumRx, for example, must purchase drugs, so each prescription filled has a variable cost (though negotiated rebates mitigate this). Overall, **variable costs scale with volume of services/members**. Encouragingly, UNH’s scale yields lower cost per unit – e.g. its size secures bulk pricing on pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, reducing per-unit expense.  
* **Fixed & Overhead Costs:** UnitedHealth also bears substantial **fixed costs** to operate its insurance and Optum businesses. **Labor expenses** are significant: UNH employs \~400,000 people including administrative staff, clinicians, and IT personnel. Annual **salaries and benefits** (part of SG\&A) exceed $40 billion. Much of this does not vary directly with short-term membership changes – e.g. maintaining call centers, claims processing systems, and compliance staff is largely fixed overhead. Another fixed cost is **technology infrastructure**. UNH invests heavily in data centers, analytics platforms, and proprietary software to manage claims and clinical data. These require ongoing maintenance (and depreciation runs \~$4 billion/year ). **Facilities** (office buildings, clinic leases) and equipment add to fixed expenses. For example, OptumHealth operates clinics and surgery centers with significant fixed facility costs regardless of patient volume. **Marketing & Advertising** is a semi-variable cost; UNH spends billions on marketing (especially to enroll Medicare Advantage seniors each year), but can be adjusted in downturns if needed. In 2025, Selling, General & Administrative (SG\&A) expenses were about **$53 billion**(12.9% of revenue) , relatively flat as a percentage of revenue as UNH’s growth has created efficiency. The chart below illustrates how **operating cost ratio** (overhead as % of revenue) has remained \~12–14%, highlighting economies of scale:

*Operating Margin (营业利润率) – UnitedHealth’s operating margin (blue) held around 7–9% for many years, as overhead costs scaled with revenue. In 2025, one-time charges caused a sharp drop to \~4.2% (yellow dot). The red dashed line is the 10-year average (\~7.9%). UNH’s consistent gross margin (毛利率, green) around 24% post-2022 reflects stable medical cost trends after reclassification of expenses in 2022\.*

* **Significant Cost Categories:** By far the largest cost line is **medical claims** (variable). In 2025, UNH’s medical costs were \~$396 billion – this encompasses payments to hospitals, physicians, pharmacies, etc. **Employee compensation** is the next biggest: salary and benefit costs for 400k employees. In 2024, total operating costs (which include payroll, admin, and other) were about $57 billion . Within that, **technology and amortization** of intangibles are notable (UNH amortizes intangible assets from acquisitions, and depreciation of equipment was \~$4.1B in 2024 ). **Pharmacy cost of goods** (for OptumRx) is also significant – the drugs OptumRx dispenses cost tens of billions (reported under medical costs or cost of revenue). **Which costs are most significant?** Medical claims dominate (roughly \~85% of revenue pre-2022, now reflected in “cost of revenue” line ). Next is people (labor) and third is technology/facilities.  
* **Trends Over Time & in Different Conditions:** UnitedHealth’s cost structure has **benefited from scale efficiencies**. Over the past decade, its **operating cost ratio** (the portion of revenue spent on overhead) has stayed flat or declined slightly (\~12–14%), even as revenues tripled . This means UNH is managing growth without proportional cost increases – automating processes and leveraging size to negotiate better vendor contracts (e.g. IT or facility leases). In strong economic times with membership growth, fixed costs are spread thinner, boosting margins. Conversely, in downturns or periods of abnormal utilization, margins tighten: e.g. in 2020, elective care deferment *improved* margins temporarily (MCR dropped as claims fell, boosting profit), whereas in 2022–2023 the catch-up in care *reduced* margins (MCR rose). UNH’s costs related to **care delivery** (Optum) are growing as it acquires more provider groups – these have a higher fixed-cost component (salaries of doctors). In inflationary periods, **wage inflation** pushes up OptumHealth’s fixed costs and **medical inflation** pushes up claims. Historically UNH has managed to price premiums to keep up, but with a lag; thus high inflation can compress margins for a year or two. The company tends to tighten administrative spending during tough times – for instance, if medical costs spike, management often implements cost containment in SG\&A (hiring freezes, etc.) to protect earnings. Overall, UNH’s cost profile is increasingly diversified (mix of insurance claim costs and provider operational costs), but its track record of steady margins suggests effective cost discipline through varying economic conditions.

## **Management & Governance**

**Current Leadership:** UnitedHealth Group has experienced a recent leadership change. In May 2025, CEO **Andrew Witty** unexpectedly stepped down, and longtime former CEO **Stephen Hemsley** returned to lead the company . Hemsley, who was CEO from 2006–2017 and remained Chairman, is now CEO again (as of Jan 2026\) . The **executive team** includes President & COO **Dirk McMahon** (a veteran of UHC operations), and CFO **John Rex** (CFO since 2016). The **Board of Directors** is chaired by Stephen Hemsley and includes founder **Richard Burke** (who founded UNH in 1977), as well as independent directors with healthcare and finance backgrounds. Notably, **Sir Andrew Witty** (former GlaxoSmithKline CEO) had been brought in to lead Optum and then became CEO in 2021, but his abrupt resignation in 2025 “for personal reasons” surprised investors . The board’s swift move to reinstall Hemsley signaled a desire for steady, experienced leadership amid industry challenges.

**Historical Leadership & Culture:** UnitedHealth’s management historically combined entrepreneurial growth with periods of controversy. Richard Burke built the firm via acquisitions, and William McGuire led it in the 1990s–2000s. McGuire resigned in 2006 over a stock option backdating scandal – an incident where UNH had to restate earnings and pay fines for misdating executive stock options . Stephen Hemsley (who had been COO) took over during that crisis and is credited with restoring integrity and driving the next decade of expansion. The **stock option scandal** did raise governance concerns (Hemsley himself forfeited options but remained with the company), but since then UNH has improved its transparency and avoided major governance lapses.

**Track Record & Credibility:** Generally, UNH’s management is known to **execute well on promises**. Over the past 10+ years, they have consistently hit earnings targets and delivered double-digit growth. They also have a reputation for **conservative guidance** – often underpromising and then raising guidance (e.g. several times in 2021–2022). One exception was early 2025: management cut the 2025 outlook and withdrew guidance due to surging costs, which caught analysts off guard . The CEO change also rattled confidence briefly. However, Hemsley’s return was viewed positively on Wall Street, given his prior track record. On earnings calls, management tends to answer analytically and *not shy away from issues*. For example, during the mid-2023 earnings call, they openly discussed higher outpatient surgery volumes driving up near-term costs, showing willingness to acknowledge problems. They also committed to remedial actions (like raising premiums and tightening cost control) – and indeed followed through, as seen by improved trends by late 2025\. That said, **investors watch for any hint of problem concealment**. The company’s decision to commission *independent business practice reviews* in 2H 2025 and publish results was meant to bolster transparency . This came after criticism that insurers were slow to disclose how cost trends were affecting earnings. By and large, UNH’s management has not been prone to hiding issues – they communicate challenges (though sometimes a bit late, as with the 2025 utilization spike).

**Management Stability & Integrity:** Many of UNH’s top leaders have long tenures at the company. Stephen Hemsley has been with UNH for 25+ years. President Dirk McMahon joined in 2003\. This continuity contributes to a deep understanding of the business. One area of scrutiny was the aforementioned stock option backdating scandal in 2006 – some questioned management integrity then, but the company reformed its compensation practices afterward. In recent years, no significant integrity questions have been raised; independent directors like former Xerox CEO Ursula Burns (on the board since 2018\) add outside oversight. **Analyst Relations:** On calls, analysts often praise UNH’s detailed breakdown of segment performance and trend commentary. Management addresses analysts’ questions directly and with granularity, which has earned them credibility. For instance, when an analyst asked about Medicare Advantage enrollment trends, management provided concrete numbers and mitigating strategies rather than glossing over it.

**Value Alignment:** UnitedHealth’s top executives generally have **significant wealth tied to UNH stock**. CEO Hemsley owns roughly 1 million shares (as of last proxy, including options), worth over $250 million, aligning his interests with shareholders. Other executives likewise hold substantial equity grants. Insider ownership is about **0.16%** of shares – not huge in percentage, but given UNH’s market cap, executives collectively are heavily invested. The **executive compensation** structure emphasizes performance shares and options that vest on achieving earnings and return targets . This incentivizes them to grow the business rather than focus on short-term salary. Notably, management has shown confidence by purchasing shares during declines. For example, then-CEO **David Wichmann personally bought 20,000 UNH shares at \~$232 in May 2019** when the stock had dipped . Such insider buys during market volatility indicate management’s belief in the company’s intrinsic value. Additionally, UNH has a pattern of **opportunistic share repurchases** – effectively, the company (with board approval) “buys stock on dips,” returning capital to shareholders when the price is attractive. In 2022–2023, when healthcare stocks underperformed, UNH accelerated buybacks (repurchasing $5.5 billion in 2023, for instance). This suggests the board/executives are value-conscious stewards of capital. Overall, management’s sizable equity stakes and history of investing in UNH stock bolster the impression that leadership’s interests are aligned with shareholders’. The executives stand to gain far more from long-term stock appreciation than from annual salaries, which is a positive alignment signal.

## **Shareholders & Capital Returns**

**Ownership Structure:** UnitedHealth Group’s shareholder base is dominated by large institutional investors. As of late 2025, **institutional holders own \~83%** of UNH’s outstanding shares . The top three holders – **The Vanguard Group (\~10%)**, **BlackRock (\~8%)**, and **State Street (\~5%)** – together own roughly 23% of the company . These are primarily passive index funds (Vanguard’s Total Stock Market index alone holds \~90 million shares) . Other notable institutions include Capital Group (around 5%), Fidelity, and Wellington. The largest individual shareholder was the late **Dr. Edson de Godoy Bueno** (a Brazilian entrepreneur whose healthcare company Amil was acquired by UNH); his estate and affiliates held about 0.97% (≈8.8 million shares) . Founder **Richard Burke** also retains a stake (several million shares). Insider ownership overall is modest (under 1%) but, as mentioned, executives hold meaningful amounts personally.

**Shareholder Voting & Activism:** Given the large index fund ownership, **proxy voting power lies with Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, etc.** These institutions typically support management on routine proposals. For example, in the 2025 annual meeting, all directors were elected with \~95% approval and the advisory vote on executive pay got strong support after a few earlier years of mixed votes (ISS had once recommended against pay in 2020, but UNH responded and engaged shareholders). **Key voted topics** often include executive compensation and shareholder proposals on political lobbying or environmental disclosure. In recent years, some shareholders proposed greater disclosure of lobbying spending – BlackRock and Vanguard have tended to support transparency initiatives generally, and UNH did enhance its reporting. However, no major activist investor campaigns have occurred; UNH’s strong performance has kept activists at bay. If anything, the “activists” influencing UNH are large pension funds pushing for ESG improvements. For instance, a **2023 Senate inquiry** into mental health coverage parity put pressure on insurers. In response, some institutional investors signaled support for resolutions urging better compliance. UNH’s top shareholders have engaged privately on such issues, but publicly they vote mostly with management. One notable vote was on **share repurchase policy**: some European funds in 2022 asked for limits on buybacks (to invest more in care), but mainstream shareholders did not support restricting management’s capital allocation flexibility. Overall, **top shareholders have broadly endorsed management’s strategy**, as evidenced by the re-election of directors like Hemsley with over 90% support. There hasn’t been a contentious shareholder vote in recent memory, reflecting investor confidence in UNH’s governance.

**Capital Return Policy (Buybacks & Dividends):** UnitedHealth employs a balanced approach to returning capital. It pays a growing **dividend** (16 consecutive years of dividend growth ) and regularly **repurchases shares**. The current quarterly dividend is $1.65/share ($8.80 annual), which is a \~3.1% yield at the current stock price . UNH typically raises the dividend \~15–20% each June (for example, it increased 14% in 2025). Even after dividend increases, the payout ratio remains moderate (\~45% of earnings) , leaving ample retained earnings for growth and buybacks. On share repurchases, the board has authorized buyback programs continuously. In June 2023, UNH’s board renewed an authorization to repurchase up to **16 million shares** (\~1.7% of shares) after exhausting the prior program. Over the past decade, **buyback spending averaged $4–9 billion per year**, which has **reduced the share count by \~1–2% annually** . For example, UNH bought back $5.0 B in 2019, $3.25 B in 2020 (pausing briefly during the pandemic uncertainty), then ramped to $5.5 B in 2021 and $9 B in 2022 . This consistent repurchasing has cumulatively retired about **100 million shares** since 2015 (shares outstanding declined from \~951M in 2015 to \~906M at end of 2025\) . The graph below shows the share count trend and buyback amounts:

*Share Count & Buybacks – UNH has steadily reduced its share count (股本减少) from \~950 million in 2015 to \~906 million in 2025 through share repurchases . The company spent \~$78 B on buybacks in the past \~15 years . Major repurchase spikes (e.g. 2019 and 2022\) coincided with stock dips, indicating opportunistic capital return.*

UNH’s capital return strategy prioritizes growing the dividend and then using remaining free cash flow for buybacks, after funding acquisitions. Notably, the company’s **free cash flow has exceeded net income** in many years, facilitating both buybacks and dividends. In the last 10 years, UNH returned approximately **$78 billion** to shareholders via buybacks while still investing in Optum acquisitions (over $20 B deployed for M\&A in that period). This shows strong cash generation supporting multi-faceted capital allocation. Top shareholders have generally approved of this strategy. There has been no serious activist pressure to change capital returns – index fund owners prefer stable dividends and moderate buybacks, which UNH provides. All major proxy advisory firms have endorsed UNH’s capital return plans as reasonable. **Voting outcomes** on say-on-pay and director elections (surrogates for shareholder satisfaction) have been overwhelmingly positive, reflecting that shareholders (big and small) are pleased with capital deployment. In summary, UNH’s largest owners – largely passive investment giants – have exercised their votes to back management and have welcomed the combination of dividend growth and share buybacks that has characterized the past decade.

## **10 Years Key Metrics (Table)**

The table below compiles UnitedHealth’s key financial metrics over the past 10 years (2015–2025). All figures are in **USD billions** except per-share items and ratios. *TTM 2025* reflects full-year 2025 results.

**Table Highlights:** Over 2015–2023, UNH’s **revenue compounded \~12% annually**, from $157 B to $372 B. Net income rose even faster (except 2024’s drop), reflecting scale benefits. **Profit margins** expanded through 2022 (net margin \~6.0% vs 3.7% in 2015), then fell in 2024–25 due to unusual costs. **Return on equity** averaged \~22%, well above peers, before dipping to 12.5% in 2025 amid the charge. UNH maintained a **low debt-to-equity (\~0.7–0.8)** and strong coverage ratios , indicating a sound balance sheet. The **P/E ratio** ranged \~20–22x for much of the decade, spiking to 27–32x when stock optimism was high (2021–2022) and reverting to \~25x by 2025\. **P/B** likewise peaked \~6.5× and is \~3.3× now with the stock pullback and higher book value. These metrics show UNH grew significantly while keeping leverage moderate and returns high, though 2024–25 mark a reset to lower profitability metrics (to be watched for rebound in 2026).

## **Buffett‑Style Checklist**

We evaluate whether UnitedHealth meets criteria often used by value investors (inspired by Buffett and others):

**1\. Valuation Discipline:**

* **P/E ≤ 15?** *No.* UNH’s trailing P/E has generally been **20+** in recent years (currently \~24.9 ). It has rarely traded at or below 15× earnings in the past decade. Even using 2024’s depressed earnings, P/E was \~32. The **historical P/E**mostly hovered in the low-20s, above the ≤15 benchmark. So it fails this strict cutoff on an absolute basis and relative to its history (UNH’s 10-year median P/E ≈ 20).  
* **PEG \< 1?** *No.* The PEG ratio (P/E divided by EPS growth rate) has typically exceeded 1\. For example, from 2018–2023, PEG was around 1.3–2.4, reflecting a \~20× P/E and \~10% earnings growth【66†】. Only in high-growth years like 2017 (EPS \+50% from tax reform) did PEG dip \<1 (that year PEG ≈0.6). But in normal years (EPS growth \~10–15%), PEG has been \>1. The current PEG (using 5-year EPS growth \~14%) is \~1.8. Thus UNH doesn’t clear the \<1 PEG hurdle.  
* **P/B ≤ 1.5?** *No.* UNH’s price-to-book is about **3.3×** now , and was as high as 6–7× during 2021\. It hasn’t been at or below 1.5 in well over a decade. However, note that a high P/B is common for an asset-light insurer with strong ROE (UNH’s ROE \~20% historically). Nonetheless, by this criterion, UNH fails (P/B \> 1.5).  
* **Margin of Safety (price ≥25% below intrinsic value)?** *Arguably not at the moment.* Based on a conservative intrinsic value estimate (see DCF below), UNH’s current market price $284 is not \>25% below our conservative intrinsic value ($321 for the nominal case). In fact, it’s **close to intrinsic value under conservative assumptions**and above intrinsic in a zero-growth scenario. So a clear 25% margin of safety is not present. In mid-2025 after a sell-off, one could argue the stock had a margin of safety (it fell to \~$250 which was \~30% below our DCF nominal value), but after rebounding, it’s roughly fairly valued to mildly undervalued by intrinsic value estimates, not a deep 25%+ discount.

**2\. Cash Generation & Allocation:**

* **Positive FCF each year & FCF/Revenue \> 5%?** *Yes.* UNH has generated **positive free cash flow every year** for decades. Over the past 10 years, FCF was consistently positive and generally growing (exceeding net income in most years). As a percentage of revenue, **FCF/Revenue** has averaged \~6–9% in 2015–2023, comfortably above the 5% threshold. For example, in 2022 FCF was $23.4 B on $324 B revenue (\~7.2%) and in 2023 \~$25.7 B on $372 B (\~6.9%). 2024 dipped to \~5.2% due to the cost spike, but still above 5% . UNH’s robust cash generation clearly meets this criterion.  
* **Return on Retained Earnings ≥ 12%?** *Yes, historically.* We assess how effectively UNH turned retained earnings into additional earnings. From 2015 to 2023, UNH retained about $87 B (cumulative net income minus dividends) and increased annual net income by \~$16.6 B over that period. Simplistically, that’s about an **19% return** on retained capital – above 12%. Another approach: UNH’s **ROE** (which reflects reinvestment returns) averaged \~22%, indicating strong returns on equity (which includes retained earnings). Even in individual years, the increase in net income relative to the prior year’s retained earnings often exceeded 12%. For example, between 2021 and 2022, UNH retained \~$11.9 B and net income grew \~$2.8 B, \~24% return on that retention. 2024 is an outlier (earnings fell despite retention), but excluding abnormal conditions, UNH has earned well above 12% on reinvested earnings. This suggests management has been effective in deploying retained earnings (through acquisitions, growth initiatives) to generate high returns.

**3\. Growth & Predictability:**

* **EPS positive & rising each year for 10 yrs?** *Almost – until 2024\.* From 2013 through 2023, UNH’s *adjusted* EPS rose every single year – a remarkable streak. GAAP EPS had one dip in 2015 due to one-time ACA charges, but then grew steadily through 2023 . *2024 broke the streak* with EPS dropping from $23.86 to $15.51 (down 35%) because of the surge in medical costs and charges. So UNH just missed having 10 years of uninterrupted EPS growth due to 2024\. However, consensus expects EPS to rebound in 2026, resuming growth. Prior to 2024, EPS CAGR was \~16% with almost clockwork annual increases. Thus UNH fails the literal “every year for 10 years” test because of 2024, but aside from that anomaly, it showed extraordinary EPS consistency.  
* **Book value/share 10-yr CAGR ≥ 10% and no year of decline?** *Yes.* Book value per share grew at \~14% CAGR from 2013–2023 (from \~$29 to \~$95). UNH’s book value/share rose each year over the past decade . Even in 2024, book value per share increased (from \~$94.6 to \~$99.8) despite profit dipping, thanks to retained earnings and share buybacks. There were *no years of book value contraction*. This reflects consistent profitability and a shareholder-friendly capital return policy that didn’t erode book value. With a double-digit CAGR and zero down years, UNH clearly meets this standard.  
* **Owner’s Earnings positive every year & OE/Market Cap ≥ 10%?** *Partially.* “Owner’s earnings” can be approximated by free cash flow (net income \+ depreciation – maintenance capex). UNH’s owner’s earnings have been positive each year (given FCF was positive). However, **OE/Market Cap ≥ 10%** (an earnings yield test) is *not*met. UNH’s FCF yield has generally been around 4–6%. For instance, at the recent price, FCF \~$16 B vs market cap \~$260 B yields 6%. Even at the 2025 low price ($250/share), FCF yield was \~8%. It has never approached 10% in the last decade, as the market consistently awarded UNH a premium valuation. So while owner earnings are solidly positive and growing, the stock has not been cheap enough to yield 10% on those earnings. Thus UNH fails the ≥10% OE yield criterion in recent history.

**4\. Balance-Sheet Safety:**

* **Debt-to-Equity \< 0.5?** *No.* UNH’s **debt-to-equity ratio** is about **0.77** (or 77%) as of 2025 . Throughout 2015–2023 it ranged from \~0.8 down to 0.5 at best in 2020, then up to 0.77 with recent debt for acquisitions. So it’s above the 0.5 threshold. However, using a broader measure, **debt-to-assets** is \~25% , indicating assets are 4× liabilities – not highly leveraged in absolute terms. UNH carries \~$78 B of debt vs \~$101 B equity, which is moderate for its stable cash flows, but strictly speaking, D/E is not below 0.5.  
* **Interest Coverage ≥ 3× (EBIT/Interest)?** *Yes.* UnitedHealth’s operating earnings easily cover its interest. In 2025, even with depressed EBIT \~$19 B, interest expense was \~$4 B , so coverage \~4.7×. In normal years, coverage was much higher: e.g. 2022 EBIT $32.3 B vs interest \~$3.25 B \=\> \~10× coverage. The **interest coverage ratio** has consistently been well above 3× (in 2023 it was \~9× ). Thus UNH handily meets this criterion except in the most unusually weak earnings quarters (and even then remained \>3×).  
* **Interest Exp. / Operating Income ≤ 15%?** *Yes.* This is effectively the inverse of coverage. In 2025, interest was \~20% of EBIT (4/19), a bit above 15% due to the one-off profit drop. But in all prior years, interest expense was \<15% of operating income. For example, 2022 interest $3.25 B vs EBIT $32.3 B \= 10%. The **10-year average**interest/EBIT is \~8%, well under 15%. UNH’s high EBITDA and moderate debt costs keep this ratio safely low in normal times. 2025 ticked up but with earnings normalization, it will fall back below 15%. Overall, UNH meets this standard (with a minor caveat for the anomalous 2025 figure around 20%).  
* **Current Ratio \> 1.5?** *No.* UNH’s **current ratio** (current assets / current liabilities) is \<1.0, around **0.79** as of 2025 . It has historically been below 1 – this is common for insurers, which receive premiums upfront (recorded as current liabilities “unearned premiums” until earned). For instance, at 12/31/2024 current assets were $85.8 B vs current liabilities $103.8 B , giving \~0.83. UNH’s strong operating cash inflows allow it to operate safely with a current ratio \<1 (claims are paid continually, not all at once). But strictly, it fails the \>1.5 test. This is more an artifact of insurance accounting; liquidity is actually sound (UNH has substantial short-term investments and cash each quarter). Nonetheless, by this metric, UNH does not pass.

**5\. Profitability & Efficiency:**

* **Gross Margin ≳ 40%?** *No (due to accounting change).* Prior to 2022, UNH’s reported gross margin appeared very high (86–90%) because only a small portion of costs were classified as “cost of revenue” (most costs were in operating expenses) . After 2021, UNH reclassified medical costs *into* cost of revenue, causing gross margin to drop to \~24% . In either case, gross margin never approached 40% once medical claims are accounted for. For a health insurer, gross margin essentially \= 100% – medical cost ratio. With an \~85% medical ratio historically, gross margin \~15%. Even including Optum’s higher-margin services, consolidated gross margin post-2022 is \~24% – well below 40%. So UNH fails this criterion. (It’s worth noting this 40% benchmark is more applicable to manufacturing or tech firms; insurers run on thin gross margins by design.)  
* **Net Profit Margin ≳ 20%?** *No.* UNH’s **net margin** peaked around 6.2% in 2022 . This is far below 20%. Health insurers generally have low net margins (single digits) due to the high claims payout ratio. UNH’s \~5–6% was actually the best in the managed care industry, but nowhere near 20%. Thus it fails this test.  
* **ROE ≥ 15% (10-yr avg)?** *Yes.* UNH’s average **Return on Equity** over the past 10 years is \~22% (ranging \~17–26% most years) . Even in 2025’s down year, ROE was \~12.5%. Excluding that, UNH consistently delivered \>15% ROE, often substantially higher. The 10-year average ROE ≈ 20–22%, so this criterion is clearly met. High ROE reflects both strong profitability and efficient use of equity (some leverage).  
* **ROIC ≥ 12% (10-yr avg)?** *Borderline to Yes.* Calculating Return on Invested Capital for insurers is tricky (intangible-heavy, etc.), but an approximate after-tax ROIC can be inferred. UNH’s EBIT margin \~8% and asset turnover \~1.5× imply ROIC \~12%. Indeed, various sources estimate UNH’s ROIC around 12–15% in recent years . For example, trailing ROIC was \~9% in 2025’s depressed earnings , but averaged \~13% over the prior 5 years. So the 10-year average ROIC is likely just at or above 12%. Thus UNH meets or nearly meets the 12% ROIC hurdle on average. It fell below in 2025 but historically exceeded it.  
* **ROA ≥ 6%?** *Yes.* Return on assets (net income/total assets) for UNH hovered \~6–8% from 2017–2022 . For instance, ROA was 8.2% in 2022 (22.4 B NI / 273.7 B assets) and \~7.2% on average last decade. Prior to 2017 it was lower (\~4–5%) due to ACA industry fees, but in recent years UNH’s ROA has been comfortably above 6%. The 10-year average ROA is slightly above 6%. (2024–25 dipped to \~4.8% and 3.9%, but those are anomalies.) Given the long-term performance, UNH passes this criterion overall.  
* **Depreciation / Gross Profit ≤ 10%?** *Yes.* Depreciation and amortization have been a small fraction of gross profit. In 2022, depreciation \~$4.0 B vs gross profit \~$90.9 B, \~4.4%. Even in 2025, dep \~$4.2 B vs GP \~$82.9 B \~5% . Earlier years pre-2022, dep was \~1–2% of the (inflated) gross profit figure. So UNH easily satisfies the condition that depreciation is under 10% of gross profit, indicating its earnings are not overly propped by depreciation (and capital intensity is moderate).

**Checklist Summary:** UnitedHealth meets many of the quality and performance criteria (high returns on equity, consistent growth until recently, strong cash flow generation, effective use of retained earnings). It falls short on several **valuation**metrics – the stock has rarely been “cheap” by P/E or P/B standards, reflecting its market premium for growth and stability. Profit margins are low in absolute percentage terms (an industry trait), so it doesn’t meet arbitrary high margin thresholds, but this is not a negative per se given the business model. Importantly, UNH excels in **efficiency (ROE, ROA)**and **cash flow** which are key Buffett-style hallmarks. The main knocks from the checklist are the lofty valuation multiples (historically) and the recent one-year earnings decline breaking its perfect growth record. On balance, UNH demonstrates many characteristics of a “great company” (durable growth, high returns, shareholder-friendly), though an adherent to deep value would have found its stock **overvalued on strict multiples** for much of the past decade.

## **DCF Analysis**

To estimate UNH’s intrinsic value, we perform a Discounted Cash Flow analysis under three scenarios: **No-Growth**, **Conservative**, and **Nominal**. We use **Free Cash Flow** (FCF) to equity as the basis, with a **required return (discount rate) of 10%** (a typical equity hurdle rate). We take the latest full-year FCF (2025’s \~$16 billion ) as the starting point.

* **No-Growth Scenario:** Assume **0% FCF growth** going forward – UNH’s FCF stays at \~$16 B annually in perpetuity, with no increase. In this zero-growth case, the DCF intrinsic value \= FCF / 10% \= **$160 billion**. On a per-share basis, that is about **$172/share** (using \~930M shares). Applying a 30% margin of safety, an attractive **“buy” price** would be **$120/share** in this pessimistic scenario. Currently, the stock trades around $284, far above the no-growth value (meaning the market is pricing in substantial growth). This scenario is very conservative – essentially it values UNH as if it never grows again. Given UNH’s historical growth, this $172/share intrinsic value is a *floor* estimate. The fact that the stock is \~65% above this indicates the market expects significant growth ahead.  
* **Conservative Scenario (Low Growth):** Assume FCF grows at a **minimal rate** – here we use **–2%** annual decline for a few years (to reflect a worst-case persistent headwind) and then zero growth thereafter. We model FCF shrinking 2% for 10 years (e.g. $16 B → $13.1 B by year 10), then stabilizing. Discounting those flows at 10% and adding a terminal value (with no growth beyond year 10\) yields an intrinsic value of approximately **$131 billion**(about **$140/share**). With a 30% margin of safety, the buy price would be **\~$98/share**. This scenario simulates long-term stagnation or erosion (perhaps due to Medicare cuts or competition). **Result:** UNH’s current price is well above $140, so if one truly believed UNH’s cash flows would decline perpetually, the stock is overvalued. However, this scenario is quite pessimistic – UNH has never had sustained FCF decline historically. It basically prices in permanent headwinds (e.g. regulatory constraints squeezing margins every year). Under this, UNH wouldn’t be a buy until under $100 (less than 4× FCF), which seems unlikely barring catastrophic change.  
* **Nominal Scenario (Average Growth):** Assume FCF grows at UNH’s **historical average** rate. Over the past 10 years, FCF grew \~10–11% annually【55†】. For a more cautious “nominal” case, we’ll use **\~11% growth for the next 10 years**, then taper to a 3% terminal growth. This reflects UNH continuing its historical performance (rebounding from the 2025 dip and then growing high single-digits in the late 2020s as the business matures). In this scenario, year 1 FCF \~$16 B grows to $45 B by year 10, and we assume a terminal growth of 3% beyond. Discounting all future cash flows at 10%, we estimate an intrinsic **value \~ $426 billion**. This equates to roughly **$458 per share**. The implied **buy price with a 30% margin of safety** would be \*\*$321/share\*\*. Notably, this nominal-case value is above the current market cap, suggesting the stock is modestly undervalued if UNH can indeed sustain \~10% FCF growth. It’s worth mentioning that our terminal growth of 3% is conservative relative to nominal GDP – if UNH managed, say, 5% perpetual growth (given healthcare tailwinds), the value would be even higher. At $458 intrinsic, the current $284 price is \~38% below intrinsic value, offering a margin of safety of about 38%. This indicates a potentially attractive long-term buy, assuming UNH’s growth normalizes.

For completeness, an **Optimistic Scenario** using *max historical growth* (around 15% FCF growth for 10 years) would yield an even higher intrinsic value (\~$570 B or \~$616/share). But such aggressive growth might be unrealistic to maintain. The *nominal 11% case* is already quite optimistic given UNH’s larger size now.

**DCF Calculations Summary:** In the no-growth case (0% forever), UNH is worth \~$172/share; in the low-growth case (FCF shrinking then flat), \~$140/share; in the average-growth case (\~10% for 10 yrs), \~$458/share. These correspond to **buy targets** (70% of intrinsic) of \~$120, $98, and $321 respectively. Because UNH is a growing enterprise with durable competitive advantages, the no-growth and decline scenarios are very unlikely long-term. The **market’s pricing (around $284)** appears to factor in mid-to-high single digit growth. Our DCF suggests **significant upside if UNH can regain a 10% growth trajectory** (intrinsic $458 vs price $284), but limited upside if growth stagnated. Thus, much of the stock’s value comes from its growth prospects. Given UNH’s track record and the secular tailwinds (aging population, expanding services), the nominal growth scenario is plausible. In that light, the stock looks reasonably valued to mildly undervalued now (with \~30%+ margin of safety if one’s confident in long-term \~10% growth). Conservative investors, however, might wait for a larger discount in case of further policy risks or market volatility.

## **Key Metrics Charts**

Below we present charts of UnitedHealth’s key metrics over the past 10 years, with **trends, averages, and min/max values** noted:

*Net Income & Margin – UNH’s net profit (净利润, blue line) rose steadily from 2015–2023, peaking at $22.4 B in 2023 . The yellow dot shows 2024’s sharp drop to $14.4 B (due to higher medical costs). Net profit margin (净利率, green) held \~5–6% until falling to 3.6% in 2024 . Red dashed line \= 10-year average \~5%. UNH’s ability to revert toward that margin is key for future earnings.*

*Return on Equity (ROE 股本回报率) – UNH delivered a high ROE (blue) around 17–26% most years, averaging \~22%. 2025’s ROE dipped to \~12.5% (yellow min marker) due to one-off hits, but ROE is expected to normalize upward. The red line shows the 10-yr avg ≈ 22%. Such consistently high ROE reflects strong profitability on shareholder capital.*

*Debt to Equity (债务股本比) – The ratio of total debt to equity (blue) was \~50–80% over the decade. It ticked up in recent years to \~77% (2025) as UNH issued debt for acquisitions . Red line \= 10-yr avg \~66%. The yellow marker (72% in 2020\) was the lowest recent D/E. UNH’s leverage is moderate and has remained \<1.0× equity.*
