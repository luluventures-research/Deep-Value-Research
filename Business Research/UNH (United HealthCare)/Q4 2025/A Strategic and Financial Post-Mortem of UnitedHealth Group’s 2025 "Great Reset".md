# **The Reshape of an Empire: A Strategic and Financial Post-Mortem of UnitedHealth Group’s 2025 "Great Reset"**

The fiscal conclusion of 2025 represents a singular inflection point in the half-century history of UnitedHealth Group. For decades, the organization functioned as an irrepressible growth engine, utilizing a vertically integrated model that seamlessly blended health insurance with clinical services, data analytics, and pharmacy care. However, the performance metrics reported on January 27, 2026, alongside the strategic guidance for the 2026-2027 period, signal the commencement of what market analysts have termed the "Great Reset".1 Under the returned leadership of Chief Executive Officer Stephen J. Hemsley, the organization is navigating a volatile confluence of unprecedented medical cost inflation, rigorous regulatory tightening in the Medicare Advantage segment, and the final financial aftershocks of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.1 This report examines the structural shifts, financial performance, and long-term strategic viability of UnitedHealth Group as it attempts to transition from an era of aggressive expansion to one of operational resilience and pricing discipline.

## **The Macro-Financial Trajectory: A Decadal Analysis of Growth and Volatility**

To comprehend the magnitude of the current realignment, one must analyze the previous decade of performance. Between 2015 and 2024, UnitedHealth Group demonstrated a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7% in revenues, consistently outperforming the broader healthcare sector and establishing itself as a dominant bellwether for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.4 This growth was predicated on the "Optum Flywheel"—a mechanism where profits from the insurance segment were reinvested into high-margin clinical and technology services, which in turn lowered the total cost of care for the insurance segment.6  
The financial results for the full year 2025, however, reveal the first significant disruption to this narrative. Consolidated revenues reached $447.6 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase, yet the net margin contracted to 2.7%.2 This margin compression is not merely a transient dip but a reflection of systemic shifts in the healthcare economy.

### **Ten-Year Revenue and Income Performance**

The historical revenue trajectory underscores a period of relentless expansion that only began to show signs of deliberate deceleration in late 2025 as the company prioritized "pricing discipline" over market share.6

| Fiscal Year | Total Revenue (B) | Revenue Growth (%) | Consolidated Net Income (B) | Net Margin (%) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2015 | $157.11 | 20.4% | $5.87 | 3.7% |
| 2016 | $184.84 | 17.7% | $7.07 | 3.8% |
| 2017 | $201.16 | 8.8% | $10.82 | 5.3% |
| 2018 | $226.25 | 12.5% | $12.38 | 5.3% |
| 2019 | $242.16 | 7.0% | $14.24 | 5.7% |
| 2020 | $257.14 | 6.2% | $15.77 | 6.0% |
| 2021 | $287.60 | 11.8% | $17.73 | 6.0% |
| 2022 | $324.16 | 12.7% | $20.64 | 6.2% |
| 2023 | $371.62 | 14.6% | $23.14 | 6.0% |
| 2024 | $400.28 | 7.7% | $15.24 | 3.6% |
| 2025 (Est) | $447.60 | 11.8% | $15.24 (Adjusted) | 2.7% |

The precipitous decline in net margin from a peak of 6.2% in 2022 to the current 2.7% is primarily attributable to a $2.8 billion full-year charge in 2025\.8 This charge reflects the final direct costs associated with the Change Healthcare cyberattack, the divestiture of non-core South American operations, and a broader restructuring effort involving workforce reductions and real estate rationalization.8 The "South American impact" is particularly notable, as it represents a strategic decision to exit volatile international markets to focus on the high-moat U.S. domestic landscape.6

### **Quarterly Performance and the Q4 2025 Inflection**

The fourth quarter of 2025 serves as the baseline for the organization's 2026 turnaround strategy. While adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.11 were in line with lowered expectations, the GAAP net income fell to a nominal $10 million for the quarter.1 This was driven by a $1.6 billion charge—approximately $1.78 per share—which management described as a necessary step to clear the path for normalized earnings in the subsequent fiscal year.1

| Metric | Q4 2025 Actual | Q4 2024 Actual | Variance (%) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Revenue | $113.22B | $100.81B | \+12.3% |
| Adjusted EPS | $2.11 | $6.81 | \-69.0% |
| Operating Margin | 0.3% | 7.7% | \-740 bps |
| Free Cash Flow Margin | 0.1% | 1.4% | \-130 bps |

The market's reaction to these results was severe, with shares declining 12.3% following the release.5 This sell-off was catalyzed not just by the Q4 miss but by a cautious 2026 revenue outlook of "greater than $439 billion," which implies a potential year-over-year revenue decline—an anomaly for a company that has defined itself through perpetual growth.1

## **Segment Deep-Dive: UnitedHealthcare and the Medicare Advantage Utilization Crisis**

UnitedHealthcare, the insurance division of the group, remains the largest private health insurer in the United States, serving 50.1 million domestic consumers.6 However, the segment’s profitability has been besieged by a shift in "Senior Utilization" patterns that began in early 2024 and accelerated through 2025\.9

### **The Medical Care Ratio (MCR) Expansion**

The Medical Care Ratio—a vital metric representing the percentage of premium revenue used for medical care—reached an adjusted 88.9% for the full year 2025\.8 This is a dramatic departure from the 82-83% range maintained during the 2020-2023 period.15  
The drivers of this MCR expansion are multi-faceted. First, there has been a notable increase in outpatient care activity among Medicare Advantage (MA) members, specifically in orthopedic and cardiovascular procedures that were delayed during the pandemic era.9 Management noted that care activity in some MA sub-segments was approximately double the rate seen in 2024\.9 Second, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have implemented funding reductions and adjustments to the "Star Ratings" system, which effectively lowered the reimbursement per member while the cost of care rose.8

| UHC Revenue Sub-segment | Q3 2025 Revenue (B) | Q3 2024 Revenue (B) | Growth Rate (%) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Medicare & Retirement | $43.4 | $34.9 | 24.0% |
| Community & State | $23.8 | $20.2 | 18.0% |
| Employer & Individual | $19.9 | $19.8 | 0.5% |

The 24% growth in Medicare & Retirement revenue is somewhat deceptive, as it includes the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) changes to the Part D pharmacy program, which increased the nominal revenue but also the associated medical costs, resulting in lower net margins.12 In the Employer & Individual segment, revenue remained flat as the company prioritized "pricing discipline" over member volume, choosing to let certain group contracts expire rather than renew them at unprofitable rates.6

### **Medicaid Redeterminations and the Community & State Outlook**

The Community & State segment, which handles Medicaid services, faced the headwind of "redeterminations"—the process where states re-verify member eligibility following the expiration of pandemic-era federal requirements.8 In 2025, the number of people served contracted by approximately 55,000, yet revenues grew by 17% due to successful negotiations for rate improvements that more accurately reflect the higher acuity (sickness) level of the remaining member pool.8 This illustrates a core organizational capability: the use of predictive analytics to demonstrate to state governments that the cost of serving complex-needs members has risen, thereby justifying higher premiums.9

## **Optum: The Transition to a Diversified Health Services Powerhouse**

If UnitedHealthcare is the engine of the group, Optum is the fuel-injection system, providing pharmacy care, clinical delivery, and technology services to both UHC and third-party insurers.6 In 2025, Optum’s performance was characterized by a strong performance in pharmacy services offset by pressures in care delivery and the lingering effects of the Change Healthcare disruption.10

### **OptumRx: The High-Volume PBM Engine**

OptumRx has emerged as a primary driver of top-line growth, with Q3 2025 revenues reaching $39.7 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase.17 This was fueled by a 3% growth in adjusted scripts and the expansion of specialty pharmacy services.9  
However, the PBM business is under intense scrutiny. In late 2025, the company announced it would pass through 100% of pharmacy rebates to clients by 2028, a move intended to preempt regulatory action and increase transparency.7 While this may put pressure on gross margins, management believes it will drive higher customer retention and attract new wins from competitors who are slower to adopt transparent pricing models.7

| Optum Segment | Q3 2025 Revenue (B) | Growth Rate (%) | Q3 2025 Operating Margin (%) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| OptumRx | $39.7 | 16% | 3.9% |
| Optum Health | $25.9 | 0% | 1.0% |
| Optum Insight | $4.9 | 0% | N/A |

### **Optum Health and Value-Based Care Pressures**

Optum Health, the care delivery arm, reported flat revenue growth in late 2025, with operating margins collapsing to 1% compared to 8.3% in the prior-year quarter.12 This collapse was the result of "care delivery pressures"—essentially the same utilization spike seen in the insurance segment affecting the clinical side of the business.17  
Despite these near-term pressures, the long-term strategy remains anchored in "Value-Based Care" (VBC). At the end of 2024, Optum Health served 4.7 million people in VBC arrangements, with an aim to add 650,000 new patients in 2025\.6 The mechanism of VBC allows Optum to receive a fixed fee per patient, incentivizing clinicians to keep patients healthy and out of the hospital, which ultimately protects the group’s consolidated margins as medical costs rise.7

### **Optum Insight and the Recovery from Cyber-Disruption**

Optum Insight, the technology and analytics division, was the segment most directly impacted by the February 2024 cyberattack on Change Healthcare.10 The disruption caused an $867 million revenue hit in 2024 as billing systems were taken offline and customers migrated to competitors.10 By late 2025, the division had stabilized, maintaining a $33 billion revenue backlog.9 The recovery strategy involves integrating Change Healthcare’s data clearinghouse capabilities with Optum’s advanced AI and analytics tools to provide a "frictionless" billing experience for providers—a critical need in an increasingly complex reimbursement environment.7

## **The Change Healthcare Cyberattack: A Systemic Stress Test and Financial Aftermath**

The cyberattack remains a defining crisis for the group, not just for its direct costs but for what it revealed about the fragility of the U.S. healthcare infrastructure. The organization responded by providing billions in accelerated payments to rural hospitals and care providers to prevent a total collapse of the system’s cash flow.19  
The final financial toll of the attack, as clarified in the Q4 2025 report, included:

* **Direct Response Costs**: Exceeding $2.5 billion pre-tax over the 2024-2025 period for forensic analysis, system restoration, and legal defense.8  
* **Capital Structure Impacts**: The disruption forced a temporary increase in short-term debt and a pause in share buybacks to ensure liquidity for provider advances.8  
* **Operational Changes**: The company created a new board committee to oversee "financial, regulatory, and reputational risks" and appointed Heather Cianfrocco as Executive Vice President of Governance to lead the long-term remediation effort.3

Management has utilized this crisis as a catalyst for a broader organizational transformation. By March 31, 2026, the company expects to complete 23 distinct "Action Plans" aimed at streamlining utilization management and improving transparency, which auditors believe will help restore consumer and regulator trust.3

## **Regulatory Environment and Political Risk**

UnitedHealth Group operates in a highly regulated ecosystem where federal and state policy shifts can have immediate billion-dollar impacts on the bottom line. The 2025-2026 period is characterized by an increasingly adversarial relationship between the organization and federal regulators.1

### **The Medicare Advantage (MA) Reimbursement Battle**

The Medicare Advantage market, once a reliable source of high-margin growth, is being squeezed by the federal government. In early 2026, CMS proposed a 0.09% rate increase for MA plans in 2027—a figure that falls far short of the 5.8% average annual healthcare cost inflation projected through 2033\.13  
This "flat" rate decision, combined with the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act, has forced UnitedHealth to engage in aggressive repricing of its 2026 MA bids.8 The implication for the broader healthcare system is significant: if the largest private insurer cannot achieve its target margins at current reimbursement rates, it will likely reduce benefits for seniors, such as dental, vision, or gym memberships, to maintain actuarial balance.14

### **Congressional Scrutiny and Lobbying Efforts**

Stephen Hemsley and other insurance CEOs have recently faced "critical strafing" from lawmakers in House and Senate hearings.1 The primary points of contention are care delays and denials through prior authorization and the perceived "inflated profits" generated through aggressive risk adjustment coding.3  
The company’s lobbying and political involvement remain substantial. Data from 2025 indicates that the organization has received over $14.2 billion in award payments from government contracts in a single year, highlighting its role as a critical partner—and therefore a target—for the federal government.27

| Government Contract Type | FY2025 Q3 April Payment | FY2025 Q3 May Payment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| EXPRESS REPORT: R3 | $830.36M | $819.32M |
| EXPRESS REPORT: R3 | $791.84M | $732.70M |

This financial interdependence between the insurer and the state creates a "too big to fail" dynamic, but it also invites constant legislative attempts to "re-capture" these profits through lower reimbursement rates or higher tax burdens.18

## **Leadership, Governance, and the Hemsley "Restoration"**

The return of Stephen Hemsley to the CEO role in May 2025 marked a significant shift in the organization's strategic direction. Hemsley, who previously served as CEO from 2006 to 2017, is widely viewed as the architect of the group's current structure.1 His return followed the retirement of Andrew Witty, whose tenure was marred by the Change Healthcare attack and the initial MA utilization spike.4

### **The $60 Million Compensation Controversy**

Hemsley’s compensation package, which includes a $1 million base salary and a one-time $60 million equity award, has been a point of friction with shareholders.29 In a June 2025 advisory vote, only 60% of shareholders supported the arrangement.30 Critics argue that the award lacks specific performance conditions and is essentially a "golden handcuffs" deal intended to keep Hemsley at the helm for at least three years.30

| Executive Name | Position | 2024/2025 Compensation | Key Governance Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Stephen Hemsley | CEO & Chairman | $1M (Sal) \+ $60M (Equity) | Strategic Turnaround |
| Andrew Witty | Former CEO | $16.4M (2024 Total) | Senior Advisor |
| Heather Cianfrocco | EVP, Governance | $11.45M | Information Security |
| Christopher Zaetta | EVP, Legal | $6.87M | Regulatory Defense |
| Erin McSweeney | EVP, People | $6.27M | Workforce Optimization |

The board’s composition remains experienced, with an average tenure of 3.3 years for management and high ROE requirements for board participation.22 However, the "Say-on-Pay" vote results and the failure of a shareholder proposal to limit "excessive golden parachutes" (which received only 94 million votes in favor vs. 655 million against) suggest that while investors are disgruntled with recent performance, the majority still trust Hemsley’s leadership to navigate the current crisis.26

### **The 23 Action Plans for Operational Integrity**

To rebuild trust, Hemsley initiated three independent audits conducted by FTI Consulting and the Analysis Group.3 These audits examined MA risk adjustment, utilization management (care denials), and PBM practices.

* **Utilization Management**: The audits showed that while UHC plans are 100% compliant with NCQA standards, nine of 62 regulatory audits had un-remediated corrective actions.24  
* **Risk Adjustment**: Policies were found to be robust but occasionally lacked recent codification.24  
* **PBM Practices**: Analysis Group found no systemic deficiencies in OptumRx’s administration of manufacturer discounts but recommended better streamlining of documentation.24

The company’s commitment to implement 23 action plans by March 2026—including "overarching policies for chart review"—is a second-order insight into the group’s move toward "self-regulation" to avoid more draconian federal oversight.3

## **Capital Structure, Shareholder Returns, and Valuation**

UnitedHealth Group has traditionally been a champion of shareholder returns, utilizing its massive free cash flow to fund dividends and repurchases. However, the 2025 "Great Reset" has temporarily altered this capital allocation strategy.19

### **The Buyback Pause and Debt Reduction Strategy**

In the second half of 2025, the company paused share buybacks to prioritize "capital structure and debt reduction".19 This move was prompted by an elevated debt-to-capital ratio of 44.1%, driven by the acquisition of Amedisys and the cash-flow impact of provider advances following the cyberattack.12

| Financial Metric | 2025 (TTM) | 2024 | 2023 | 2015 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Debt-to-Capital | 43.9% | 43.9% | 40.5% | 42.8% |
| Debt-to-Equity | 0.71 | 0.74 | 0.62 | 0.75 |
| Current Ratio | 0.82 | 0.83 | 0.79 | 0.74 |
| ROE | 17.5% | 15.0% | 25.1% | 17.6% |

Management expects to return the debt-to-capital ratio to approximately 40% by late 2026 through earnings recovery and a $5.2 billion reduction in outstanding commercial paper.8 Once this leverage target is met, the company anticipates reinstating its "historical capital deployment practices," which includes $10 billion or more in annual share repurchases.19

### **Dividend Growth: A Sixteen-Year Streak**

While buybacks were paused, the company maintained and increased its dividend, paying $2.21 per share in late 2025\.33 This represents a 16-year streak of dividend increases, a track record that provides a valuation floor for long-term income investors.34

| Year | Q1 Dividend | Q2 Dividend | Q3 Dividend | Q4 Dividend | Total Annual |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2025 | $2.10 | $2.21 | $2.21 | $2.21 | $8.73 |
| 2024 | $1.88 | $2.10 | $2.10 | $2.10 | $8.18 |
| 2023 | $1.65 | $1.88 | $1.88 | $1.88 | $7.29 |
| 2022 | $1.45 | $1.65 | $1.65 | $1.65 | $6.40 |
| 2021 | $1.25 | $1.45 | $1.45 | $1.45 | $5.60 |

For comparison, in 2015, the annual dividend was only $1.87 per share.35 This represents a dividend CAGR of approximately 16.6% over the last decade, far exceeding inflation and providing substantial total returns for patient shareholders.33

### **Valuation: PEG Ratio and Peer Comparison**

Following the 35% stock price decline in 2025, UnitedHealth Group’s valuation has reached levels not seen since 2013-2014.36 The Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio as of January 2026 is approximately 18.5x, significantly lower than its five-year average of 22-25x.36  
The Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio—a critical measure for value investors—stands at 0.74.34 A PEG ratio below 1.0 generally indicates that a stock is undervalued relative to its earnings growth potential. This suggests that the current market price reflects a "worst-case scenario" regarding Medicare Advantage funding and utilization, potentially offering an attractive entry point for investors who believe in the company’s ability to re-price its contracts and restore its 13-16% EPS growth target by 2027\.25

| Ticker | P/E Ratio | Price/Book | Price/Sales | PEG Ratio | 1Y Stock Change |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **UNH** | **18.1x** | **3.3x** | **0.7x** | **0.74** | **\-35.3%** |
| CVS | 12.2x | 1.5x | 0.3x | 1.1x | \-10.2% |
| CI | 9.9x | 1.8x | 0.3x | N/A | \-15.4% |
| HUM | 14.9x | 2.0x | 0.5x | 0.78 | \-45.9% |

The sector-wide sell-off, particularly impacting Humana (down 45.9%), highlights that UNH's troubles are industry-wide, yet UNH's diversified revenue through Optum provides a cushion that pure-play insurers like Humana do not possess.14

## **Operational Efficiency and the Workforce Strategy**

The "Great Reset" is not just a financial or strategic concept but an operational reality for the company's 400,000+ employees. To support its 2026 turnaround, management is engaging in a massive realignment of its labor force.8

### **Operating Cost Ratio and Incentive Structures**

The company’s operating cost ratio—the percentage of revenue spent on administrative and general expenses—stood at 13.5% in late 2025\.12 This reflects significant investments in technology and $450 million in broad-based employee incentives and foundation contributions intended to stabilize the workforce after a year of restructuring.19  
The labor expense is a primary component of the $408.8 billion in total annual operating expenses.40 The average estimated annual salary at the group is $124,340, but this varies wildly by department.

| Department | Average Salary | High-End Title | High Salary |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Communications | $230,391 | Executive VP | $300,000+ |
| Engineering | $149,059 | Director of Engineering | $166,679+ |
| Marketing | $107,299 | Director of Marketing | $188,951 |
| Operations | $66,569 | Director of Operations | $113,701 |
| Finance | $71,971 | Controller | $150,000+ |

To maintain its competitive edge in "Health Technology," the company must continue to pay premium salaries for data scientists and principal designers ($160k+) despite the overall push for cost reduction.41 This creates a tension between the need for margin expansion and the need to retain the human capital required for Optum’s advanced analytics.41

### **Capital Expenditures: Maintaining the Infrastructure**

UnitedHealth’s capital expenditures (CapEx) are primarily directed toward technology systems, clinics, and office buildings. In 2025, TTM CapEx reached $3.586 billion, roughly 0.8% of revenue.43

| Year | Total CapEx (B) | CapEx Growth (%) | Revenue (%) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 2021 | $2.454 | 19.6% | 0.9% |
| 2022 | $2.802 | 14.2% | 0.9% |
| 2023 | $3.386 | 20.8% | 0.9% |
| 2024 | $3.499 | 3.3% | 0.9% |
| 2025 (TTM) | $3.586 | 2.5% | 0.8% |

A second-order insight into this data is the relationship between CapEx and Depreciation. In 2024, Depreciation was $4.09 billion, while CapEx was $3.50 billion.43 When depreciation consistently exceeds CapEx, it suggests that the company is in a mature phase where it is harvesting cash from past investments rather than aggressively building new physical infrastructure.31 For UnitedHealth, this indicates that the "Great Reset" involves a shift from being a "builder" to a "refiner" of healthcare assets.7

## **Stakeholder Activity and Insider Sentiment**

The internal sentiment among management and board members provides a critical counterpoint to the bearishness of the public markets. Following the "disastrous" Q1 2025 performance, five top executives and directors, including Hemsley and Rex, purchased company stock on the open market, signaling confidence in the long-term turnaround.4

### **Insider Trading and Congressional Activity**

Specifically, Hemsley made a $25 million purchase of 86,700 shares at an average price of $288.57 in May 2025\.4 This "insider buy" is often viewed as a strong signal of conviction, as it aligns the CEO's personal wealth with the successful implementation of the 23 Action Plans.4

| Name | Role | Date | Shares | Transaction |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Stephen Hemsley | CEO | 2025-05-16 | 86,700 | Buy ($25.0M) |
| John Rex | President/CFO | 2025-05-16 | 17,175 | Buy ($5.0M) |
| Kristen Gil | Director | 2025-05-15 | 3,700 | Buy ($1.0M) |
| Charles Baker | Director | 2025-09-11 | 27 | Sell ($9.6k) |
| Patrick Conway | CEO Optum | 2025-06-10 | 589 | Sell ($179k) |

Conversely, members of Congress have been active traders of UNH stock, with 25 trades in the latter half of 2025\.27 Representative Kevin Hern sold up to $500,000 in December 2025, while others like Representative Gilbert Ray Cisneros, Jr. engaged in multiple purchases and sales.27 This level of congressional activity underscores the political sensitivity of the stock, as lawmakers who trade the shares are often the same individuals voting on the legislation that impacts the company’s reimbursement rates.27

## **The 2026-2027 Outlook: Transition to Recovery**

The strategic guidance for 2026 is intentionally conservative. Management expects revenues to decline slightly to "greater than $439 billion," while earnings from operations are projected to rise to greater than $24.0 billion.2 This implies a significant improvement in operating margins—from 4.2% in 2025 to approximately 5.5% in 2026—as the non-recurring charges of the "reset" drop off and the repriced contracts take effect.2

### **Key Strategic Growth Priorities**

To achieve this recovery, the organization has identified five strategic growth priorities:

1. **Value-Based Care Integration**: Moving more patients into Optum Health clinics where UHC has a "capitated" (fixed-fee) risk model.6  
2. **Pharmacy Transparency**: Utilizing OptumRx to lower drug costs and integrating direct-to-consumer pharmacy offerings.7  
3. **Health Technology Simplification**: Leveraging the restored Change Healthcare clearinghouse to simplify administrative processes and reduce the "friction" that leads to provider frustration.7  
4. **Financial Services Streamlining**: Improving the accuracy and experience of provider payments, reducing the need for costly appeals and audits.7  
5. **Consumer-Centered Benefits**: Building simpler, more affordable plans for the ACA exchanges and Employer groups that prioritize choice and better outcomes.7

The "Reset" of 2025 was painful, costing the group over $288 billion in market capitalization at its lowest point.4 Yet, by clearing the balance sheet of international underperformers and systemically addressing its operational vulnerabilities, UnitedHealth Group is positioning itself to remain the dominant player in the next era of U.S. healthcare—one defined not by membership growth alone, but by the efficiency and transparency of care delivery.1  
The organization’s ability to return to its 13-16% adjusted EPS growth target by 2027 remains the central question for investors. While the 2026 transition year will likely be characterized by low-single-digit revenue growth and margin stabilization, the persistence of the 16-year dividend streak and the massive insider buying by Hemsley and Rex suggest that the leadership believes the "Great Reset" has successfully bottomed out the company’s risks.4 For the broader healthcare system, the success or failure of UnitedHealth’s turnaround will serve as a proxy for the viability of the managed care model in a high-cost, high-regulation environment.13  
The road to 2027 will be defined by "pricing discipline" and "operational rigor"—terms that management uses repeatedly to signal to Wall Street that the era of growth-at-any-cost is over, replaced by a focus on sustainable, high-moat profitability within the domestic U.S. market.13 As the 23 Action Plans reach completion by March 2026, the market will look for a stabilization of the Medical Care Ratio and a return to the share buyback program as definitive proof that the empire has been successfully reshaped.8
