## Content Standards

### Company Analysis Framework

All company analyses follow the Buffett-style framework with these components:
1. **Qualitative Gates** - Business simplicity, moat, management quality, industry structure
2. **Business Economics** - Customer value, switching behavior, revenue quality
3. **Financial Analysis** - Owner earnings, profitability metrics, balance sheet health
4. **Valuation** - Multiple methodologies (DCF, P/E, P/B, intrinsic value)
5. **Risk Assessment** - Key dependencies and potential challenges

### Metrics Standard

Company analyses include 30+ financial metrics covering:
- Profitability (ROE, ROA, margins)
- Growth (revenue, earnings, FCF trends)
- Valuation (P/E, P/B, P/S, DCF)
- Risk indicators

### Bilingual Content

Some reports are available in both English and Chinese (中文). When adding bilingual content, maintain separate files for each language.

## Working with Content

- All content files are markdown (.md)
- Company analyses are organized by ticker symbol (e.g., `Business Research/AAPL (Apple)/`)
- Date analysis documents appropriately (e.g., "Q3 2025 analysis")
- Maintain consistency with the established analysis framework
- Include professional data visualizations where appropriate
