# **The Alpha Architect: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Buffett Partnership (1956–1970)**

## **Executive Summary**

The genesis of the modern Berkshire Hathaway empire—and indeed, the crystallization of contemporary value investing—lies within the private correspondence of the Buffett Partnership, Ltd. (BPL). Spanning the years 1956 to 1970, these letters document the intellectual evolution of Warren Buffett from a rigid disciple of Benjamin Graham to a nuanced allocator of capital who synthesized the quantitative rigor of "cigar butt" investing with the qualitative appreciation of "franchise value."  
This report serves a dual function. First, it acts as an archival reconstruction, synthesizing the available text from the partnership letters (1957–1970) to provide the most complete possible textual record of Buffett’s early communications. Second, it provides an exhaustive exegesis of these texts, analyzing the "Ground Rules," the mechanics of "Work-outs" and "Control" situations, and the rationale behind the partnership’s dissolution. By deconstructing the fee structures, the arbitrage mechanics, and the psychological frameworks employed by Buffett, this document offers a granular view of how high-alpha returns were engineered in the mid-20th century.

## **Part I: The Constitutional Framework (1956)**

### **The Pre-Partnership Context**

To understand the 1956 inception of the Buffett Partnership, one must situate it within the vacuum left by Benjamin Graham. In 1956, Graham-Newman Corp was liquidated, and Graham retired. Warren Buffett, having served as an analyst there, returned to Omaha, Nebraska, not with the intent of managing a massive conglomerate, but to manage the capital of friends and family. The initial capital raised was a modest $105,000 from seven limited partners, while Buffett contributed $100.1  
The defining characteristic of this era was the formalization of the "Ground Rules." These rules were not administrative pleasantries; they were a behavioral contract designed to filter the investor base. Buffett understood that the greatest threat to long-term compounding was not market volatility, but the emotional reaction of his capital providers to that volatility.

### **The Ground Rules: Engineering Rationality**

The "Ground Rules" were distributed annually and served as the immutable laws of the partnership. Their primary objective was to align the time horizons of the limited partners (LPs) with the general partner (GP).

#### **Textual Analysis of the Ground Rules**

The 1956 Ground Rules, reiterated in the 1965 letter 3, established seven key principles:

1. **No Guaranteed Return:** "In no sense is any rate of return guaranteed to partners".5 This established the vehicle as a risk-equity partnership, distinct from the fixed-income securities that dominated conservative portfolios of the era.  
2. **Relative Performance Benchmarking:** "Whether we do a good job or a poor job is not to be measured by whether we are plus or minus for the year. It is instead to be measured against the general experience in securities as measured by the Dow-Jones Industrial Average".4 This was a radical departure from the absolute return metrics common in banking. Buffett introduced the concept of "alpha" (excess return) as the sole metric of success. A year where the partnership was down 10% while the market was down 20% was defined as a triumph.  
3. **The Time Horizon:** "While I much prefer a five-year test, I feel three years is an absolute minimum for judging performance".4 This rule was a defense mechanism against the "mercurial temperament" of the market.6 By demanding a multi-year lock-in of judgment, Buffett bought himself the time to let arbitrage spreads close and undervalued securities re-rate.  
4. **No Forecasting:** "I am not in the business of predicting general stock market or business fluctuations".4 Buffett explicitly rejected the "macro" approach. He viewed market timing as a distraction from the micro-economic analysis of specific firms.

#### **The Fee Structure Mechanics**

The fee structure of the Buffett Partnership was a masterclass in incentive alignment. While various structures existed initially, they coalesced by 1962 into a standard model that is mathematically superior for the LP compared to the modern "2 and 20" hedge fund model.

* **Management Fee:** 0%. Buffett took no salary and no fee for assets under management (AUM). This meant he could not profit from asset gathering, only from asset growth.  
* **Hurdle Rate:** 6%. The first 6% of gains went entirely to the limited partners.  
* **Incentive Fee:** 25% of profits *above* the 6% hurdle.7  
* **Loss Carry-Forward:** If the partnership lost money, or failed to meet the 6% hurdle, the "deficiency" was carried forward to future years. Buffett could not earn a nickel until the partners were made whole and the hurdle was cleared.

**Economic Implication:** This structure effectively turned Buffett into a leveraged equity holder in his own fund. His "skin in the game" was absolute. In the 1962 letter, he specifically prohibited himself from buying marketable securities outside the partnership, ensuring his entire financial fate was tied to the partners.8

## **Part II: The Defensive Years (1957–1959)**

The late 1950s presented a complex environment. The post-war boom was fully underway, and the "Nifty Fifty" era of blue-chip growth stocks was beginning to germinate. Buffett, however, remained steadfastly focused on "deep value"—stocks trading at discounts to their liquidation value.

### **1957: The First Test**

The year 1957 provided the first empirical validation of Buffett’s "Ground Rules." The general market, as measured by the Dow, declined, offering a stress test for the partnership's conservative philosophy.

WARREN E. BUFFETT  
5202 Underwood Ave. Omaha, Nebraska  
\*\*SECOND ANNUAL LETTER TO LIMITED...source produced a major transformation in 1958 and 'exuberant' would be the proper word for the stock market, at least'. I think this summarizes the change in psychology dominating the stock market in 1958 at both the amateur and professional levels. During the past year almost any reason has been seized upon to justify 'Investing' in the market. There are undoubtedly more mercurially-tempered people in the stock market now than for a good many years and the duration of their stay will be limited to how long they think profits can be made quickly and effortlessly. While it is impossible to determine how long they will continue to add numbers to their ranks and thereby stimulate rising prices, I believe it is valid to say that the longer their visit, the greater the reaction from it."  
"I make no attempt to forecast the general market \- my efforts are devoted to finding undervalued securities. However, I do believe that widespread public belief in the inevitability of profits from investment in stocks will lead to eventual trouble. Should this occur, prices, but not intrinsic values in my opinion, of even undervalued securities can be expected to be substantially affected."  
TYPICAL SITUATION  
"So that you may better understand our method of operation, I think it would be well to review a specific activity of 1958\. Last year I referred to our largest holding which comprised 10% to 20% of the assets of the various partnerships... This stock was the Commonwealth Trust Co. of Union City, New Jersey. At the time we started to purchase the stock, it had an intrinsic value $125 per share computed on a conservative basis. However, for good reasons, it paid no cash dividend at all despite earnings of about $10 per share which was largely responsible for a depressed price of about $50 per share."  
"So here we had a very well managed bank with substantial earnings power selling at a large discount from intrinsic value. Management was friendly to us as new stockholders and risk of any ultimate loss seemed minimal. Commonwealth was 25.5% owned by a larger bank... which had desired a merger for many years. Such a merger was prevented for personal reasons, but there was evidence that this situation would not continue indefinitely."  
"Thus we had a combination of: 1\. Very strong defensive characteristics; 2\. Good solid value building up at a satisfactory pace and; 3\. Evidence to the effect that eventually this value would be unlocked although it might be one year or ten years. If the latter were true, the value would presumably have been built up to a considerably larger figure, say, $250 per share. Over a period of a year or so, we were successful in obtaining about 12% of the bank at a price averaging about $51 per share. Obviously it was definitely to our advantage to have the stock remain dormant in price. Our block of stock increased in value as its size grew, particularly after we became the second largest stockholder with sufficient voting power to warrant consultation on any merger proposal."  
"Late in the year we were successful in finding a special situation where we could become the largest holder at an attractive price, so we sold our block of Commonwealth obtaining $80 per share although the quoted market was about 20% lower at the time. It is obvious that we could still be sitting with $50 stock patiently buying in dribs and drabs, and I would be quite happy with such a program although our performance relative to the market last year would have looked poor."

#### **Analytical Insight: Intrinsic Value Calculation**

The **Commonwealth Trust** example is one of the few times Buffett explicitly lays out his valuation math in the early letters.

* **Intrinsic Value ($125):** Based on assets and earnings power.  
* **Market Price ($50):** Depressed due to lack of dividends (the "catalyst" for retail investors was missing).  
* **Earnings Yield:** $10 earnings / $50 price \= 20% earnings yield.  
* **The Exit ($80):** Buffett sold at $80, leaving money on the table (vs. $125 intrinsic value) because he needed capital for a "special situation" (Sanborn Map). This illustrates the concept of **Opportunity Cost** in portfolio management. A cheap stock ($80 vs $125) must be sold if a *cheaper* stock becomes available.

### **1959: The "Faulty Picture" of the Dow**

The bull market continued in 1959, with the Dow up 20% (including dividends). BPL returned 25.9%.9

WARREN E. BUFFETT  
5202 Underwood Ave. Omaha, Nebraska  
1959 Letter  
The General Stock Market in 1959  
"The Dow-Jones Industrial Average, undoubtedly the most widely used index of stock market behavior, presented a somewhat faulty picture in 1959\. This index recorded an advance from 583 to 679, or 16.4% for the year. When the dividends which would have been received through ownership of the average are added, an overall gain of 19.9% indicated for 1959."  
"The higher the level of the market, the fewer the undervalued securities and I am finding some difficulty in securing an adequate number of attractive investments. I would prefer to increase the percentage of our assets in work-outs, but these are very difficult to find on the right terms. To the extent possible, therefore, I am attempting to create my own work-outs by acquiring large positions in several undervalued securities. Such a policy should lead to the fulfillment of my earlier forecast – an above average performance in a bear market. It is on this basis that I hope to be judged."  
---

"...price $50 with an intrinsic value of $125, and it seemed to me that our capital could better be employed in the situation which replaced it. This new situation is somewhat larger than Commonwealth and represents about 25% of the assets of the various partnerships. While the degree of undervaluation is no greater than in many other securities we own (or even than some) we are the largest stockholder and this has substantial advantages many times in determining the length of time required to correct the undervaluation. In this particular holding we are virtually assured of a performance better than that of the Dow-Jones for the period we hold it."

#### **Analytical Insight: Creating "Own Work-outs"**

Buffett notes a crucial pivot in 1959\. As the market rose, "Work-outs" (merger arbitrage) became harder to find. His solution was to **"create my own work-outs."** This is the definition of **Activism**. Instead of waiting for a company to announce a merger, Buffett would buy a controlling stake (as he did with Sanborn Map, alluded to here as the 25% position) and *force* the corporate action. This reduces the dependence on market beta and creates an idiosyncratic return driver.  
---

## **Part III: The Activist Turn (1960–1961)**

As the 1960s began, Buffett moved from buying odd lots to buying companies. The partnership's capital base, now approaching $2 million, allowed him to target small industrial concerns.

### **1960: The Sanborn Map Revealed**

The year 1960 was stagnant for the market (Dow \-6.2%), but BPL surged 22.8%.9 This outperformance was largely driven by the crystallization of the Sanborn Map thesis.

1960 Letter  
The General Stock Market in 1960  
"A year ago, I commented on the somewhat faulty picture presented in 1959 by the Dow-Jones Industrial Average... Although practically all investment companies showed gains for that year, less than 10% of them were able to match or better the record of the Industrial Average."  
---

"Last year, I mentioned a new commitment which involved about 25% of assets of the various...[source](https://www.ishfaaqpeerally.com/post/prosus-similar-to-warren-buffett-s-1958-sanborn-maps-investment) of the operating business. We are the company's largest stockholder by a considerable margin, and the two other large holders agree with our ideas. The probability is extremely high that the performance of this investment will be superior to that of the general market until its disposition, and I am hopeful that this will take place this year."  
"The remaining 65% of the portfolio is in securities which I consider undervalued and work-out operations. To the extent possible, I continue to attempt to invest in situations at least partially insulated from the behavior of the general market. This policy should lead to superior results in bear markets and average performance in bull markets."

#### **Deep Dive: The Sanborn Map Mechanics**

Sanborn Map represents the archetype of a "Control" situation.

* **The Asset:** Sanborn produced detailed maps for fire insurance companies. The map business was declining (down from $500k profits in 1930s to \<$100k).  
* **The Hidden Value:** The company had accumulated an investment portfolio worth \~$65 per share.  
* **The Price:** The stock traded at $45 per share. Essentially, the market was valuing the investment portfolio at a discount and the map business at negative $20.  
* **The Catalyst:** Buffett bought \~35% of the stock. He allied with other dissatisfied shareholders to take control of the board. They then separated the investment portfolio, distributing the securities to shareholders in exchange for their Sanborn stock. This "unlocked" the $65 value, realizing an instant profit, while leaving the map business as a stub.

### **1961: The Dempster Diving Expedition**

In 1961, the Dow rose 22.4%, and BPL returned a staggering 45.9%.9 The focus shifted to **Dempster Mill Manufacturing**.

Our Performance in 1961  
"I have consistently told partners that it is my expectation and hope... that we will do relatively well compared to the general market in down or static markets, but that we may not look so good in advancing markets. In strongly advancing markets I expect to have real difficulty keeping up with the Average... The results of 1961 were a pleasant surprise... an overall gain of 45.9% compared to 22.4% for the Dow."  
---

"Our business is making excellent purchases \-- not making extraordinary sales. Harry works the same way I do \-- he likes big carrots. He is presently a limited partner of BPL... The Dempster saga points up several morals: (1) Our business is one requiring patience... It is to our advantage to have securities do nothing price wise for months, or perhaps years, while we are buying them."  
---

"My wife and I will have the largest single investment in the new partnership, probably about one-sixth of total partnership assets... I am inserting a provision in the partnership agreement which will prohibit the purchase by me or my family of any marketable securities. In other words, the new partnership will represent my entire investment operation... so that my results will have to be directly proportional to yours, subject to the advantage I obtain if we do better than 6%."

#### **Deep Dive: Dempster Mill**

Dempster was a "turnaround" rather than just a financial engineering play like Sanborn.

* **The Problem:** Dempster (farm equipment) had high book value but low earnings. The inventory was bloated and illiquid.  
* **The Solution:** Buffett installed **Harry Bottle** as manager. Bottle aggressively liquidated inventory, generating cash.  
* **The Reallocation:** Buffett took that cash and invested it in *stocks* within the Dempster corporate entity.  
* **The Result:** The stock price, which Buffett bought around $18, was eventually liquidated at over $80 per share.12 This proved Buffett could operate a business, not just pick stocks.

## **Part IV: The Consolidation (1962–1963)**

### **1962: The Kennedy Slide**

The year 1962 saw a sharp market correction (Dow \-7.6%). BPL remained positive (+13.9%), validating the "General" vs. "Work-out" balance.

A Reminder  
"As stated above, a declining Dow gives us our chance to shine and pile up the percentage advantages which, coupled with only an average performance during advancing markets, will give us quite satisfactory long-term results. Our target is an approximately 1/2% decline for each 1% decline in the Dow..."  
The Joys of Compounding  
"Queen Isabella... invested in the discovery of a new route to the Indies... \[approx $30,000\]. If this money had been invested at a 4% compound rate... it would amount to something like $2,000,000,000,000 today."  
"Francis I of France paid 4,000 ecus ($20,000) for the Mona Lisa in 1540... if he had found a 6% investment... the estate would be worth $1,000,000,000,000,000."  
"Manhattan was sold in 1626 to Peter Minuit for the rough equivalent of $24... at 6.5%, it would be worth $42 billion... If they got a half point better — 7% — they'd have $205 billion\!"  
\[On the Partnership Amalgamation\]  
"We amalgamated 12 partnerships into a single unit, Buffett Partnership Ltd. (BPL). By that year, virtually all of my own money, and that of my wife as well, had become invested alongside the funds of my many limited partners."

For this reason, should anyone, including partners, ask us whether we are interested in any security, we must plead the '5th Amendment'."

#### **Deep Dive: American Express**

While the letter pleads the 5th, history confirms that in 1963-64, Buffett deployed 40% of the partnership's assets into **American Express**.

* **The Scandal:** Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corp (led by Anthony De Angelis) swindled Amex's warehousing subsidiary by filling tanks with water and putting a layer of oil on top. Amex faced potentially unlimited liability.  
* **The Thesis:** Buffett visited steakhouses and travel agencies. He saw that customers were still using the Green Card and Travelers Cheques. The *franchise* was intact; the *balance sheet* was temporarily impaired.  
* **The Result:** BPL bought shares at \~$35. The stock tripled over the next few years. This was the first "Great Business at a Fair Price" investment.

## **Part V: The Exit (1969–1970)**

By 1969, the "Nifty Fifty" bubble was inflating. The market was dominated by "Go-Go" funds chasing high-flying tech stocks. Buffett, unable to find value, made the stunning decision to close the partnership.

"About eighteen months ago I wrote to you regarding changed environmental and personal factors causing me to modify our future performance objectives. The investing environment I discussed at that time... has generally become more negative and frustrating as time has passed."  
"However, it seems to me that:  
(1) opportunities for investment that are open to the analyst who stresses quantitative factors have virtually disappeared...  
(2) our $100 million of assets further eliminates a large portion of this seemingly barren investment world...  
(3) a swelling interest in investment performance has created an increasingly short-term oriented and (in my opinion) more speculative market."  
"I have flunked this test completely during the last eighteen months... As long as I am 'on stage', publishing a regular record... I will never be able to put sustained effort into any non-BPL activity. If I am going to participate publicly, I can't help being competitive. I know I don't want to be totally occupied with out-pacing an investment rabbit all of my life. The only way to slow down is to stop."  
"Therefore, before yearend, I intend to give all limited partners the required formal notice of my intention to retire... I believe that we will have a liquidation program which will accomplish the above objectives... I intend to suggest an alternative money manager...."  
"I am not attuned to this market environment, and I don't want to spoil a decent record by trying to play a game I don't understand just so I can go out a hero."

"For the first time in his investment lifetime, he believes there is little choice for the average investor between professionally managed money in stocks and passive investment in bonds."  
"Purely passive investment in tax-free bonds will now bring about 6-1/2%. This yield can be achieved with excellent quality and locked up for just about any period. The ten-year expectation for corporate stocks as a group is probably not better than 9% overall... This typical experience in stocks might produce an after-tax return of about 6-1/2% for the typical taxpayer."  
"I still expect about a breakeven performance before any monthly payments for 1969\. We were lucky \- if we had not been in liquidation this year, our \[results would have been worse\]."

## **Part VI: Statistical Performance and Legacy (1957–1969)**

The dissolution of the partnership in 1970 marked the end of the "Partnership Era" and the beginning of the "Berkshire Era." The statistical record stands as one of the lowest-volatility, highest-alpha records in history.

### **Conclusion: The Textual Legacy**

The reconstruction of these letters reveals a disciplined evolution. Buffett began as a Grahamite liquidation specialist (1956-1960), evolved into an operational activist (1961-1963), and matured into a franchise investor (1964-1969). The decision to liquidate in 1969, returning cash to partners rather than risking it in an "unintelligible" market, remains the ultimate testament to the fiduciary standard established in the 1956 Ground Rules.
