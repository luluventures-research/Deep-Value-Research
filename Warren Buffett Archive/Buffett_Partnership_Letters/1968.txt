1968. Whereas the
Partnership Agreement represents the legal understanding among us, the "Ground Rules" represent the personal
understanding and in some ways is the more important document. I consider it essential that any changes be
clearly set forth and explained prior to their effect on partnership activity or performance – hence, the October
letter.

To My Partners:

Over the past eleven years, I have consistently set forth as the BPL investment goal an average advantage in our
performance of ten percentage points per annum in comparison with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Under
the environment that existed during that period. I have considered such an objective difficult but obtainable.

The following conditions now make a change in yardsticks appropriate:

    1. The market environment has changed progressively over the past decade, resulting in a sharp diminution
       in the number of obvious quantitatively based investment bargains available;

    2. Mushrooming interest in investment performance (which has its ironical aspects since I was among a
       lonely few preaching the importance of this some years ago) has created a hyper-reactive pattern of
       market behavior against which my analytical techniques have limited value;

    3. The enlargement of our capital base to about $65 million when applied against a diminishing trickle of
       good investment ideas has continued to present the problems mentioned in the January, 1967 letter; and

    4. My own personal interests dictate a less compulsive approach to superior investment results than when I
       was younger and leaner.

Let's look at each of these factors in more detail.

The evaluation of securities and businesses for investment purposes has always involved a mixture of qualitative
and quantitative factors. At the one extreme, the analyst exclusively oriented to qualitative factors would say.
"Buy the right company (with the right prospects, inherent industry conditions, management, etc.) and the price
will take care of itself.” On the other hand, the quantitative spokesman would say, “Buy at the right price and
the company (and stock) will take care of itself.” As is so often the pleasant result in the securities world, money
can be made with either approach. And, of course, any analyst combines the two to some extent - his
classification in either school would depend on the relative weight he assigns to the various factors and not to
his consideration of one group of factors to the exclusion of the other group.

Interestingly enough, although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school (and as I write this no
one has come back from recess - I may be the only one left in the class), the really sensational ideas I have had
over the years have been heavily weighted toward the qualitative side where I have had a "high-probability
insight". This is what causes the cash register to really sing. However, it is an infrequent occurrence, as insights
usually are, and, of course, no insight is required on the quantitative side - the figures should hit you over the
head with a baseball bat. So the really big money tends to be made by investors who are right on qualitative
decisions but, at least in my opinion, the more sure money tends to be made on the obvious quantitative
decisions.

Such statistical bargains have tended to disappear over the years. This may be due to the constant combing and
recombing of investments that has occurred during the past twenty years, without an economic convulsion such
as that of the ‘30s to create a negative bias toward equities and spawn hundreds of new bargain securities. It may


                                                                                                                111
be due to the new growing social acceptance, and therefore usage (or maybe it's vice versa - I'll let the
behaviorists figure it out) of takeover bids which have a natural tendency to focus on bargain issues. It may be
due to the exploding ranks of security analysts bringing forth an intensified scrutiny of issues far beyond what
existed some years ago. Whatever the cause, the result has been the virtual disappearance of the bargain issue as
determined quantitatively - and thereby of our bread and butter. There still may be a few from time to time.
There will also be the occasional security where I am really competent to make an important qualitative
judgment. This will offer our best chance for large profits. Such instances will. however, be rare. Much of our
good performance during the past three years has been due to a single idea of this sort.

The next point of difficulty is the intensified interest in investment performance. For years I have preached the
importance of measurement. Consistently I have told partners that unless our performance was better than
average, the money should go elsewhere. In recent years this idea has gained momentum throughout the
investment (or more importantly, the investing) community. In the last year or two it has started to look a bit like
a tidal wave. I think we are witnessing the distortion of a sound idea.

I have always cautioned partners that I considered three years a minimum in determining whether we were
"performing". Naturally, as the investment public has taken the bit in its teeth, the time span of expectations has
been consistently reduced to the point where investment performance by
large aggregates of money is being measured yearly, quarterly, monthly, and perhaps sometimes even more
frequently (leading to what is known as "instant research"). The payoff for superior short term performance has
become enormous, not only in compensation for results actually achieved, but in the attraction of new money for
the next round. Thus a self-generating type of activity has set in which leads to larger and larger amounts of
money participating on a shorter and shorter time span. A disturbing corollary is that the vehicle for
participation (the particular companies or stocks) becomes progressively less important - at times virtually
incidental - as the activity accelerates.

In my opinion what is resulting is speculation on an increasing scale. This is hardly a new phenomenon;
however, a dimension has been added by the growing ranks of professional (in many cases formerly quite
docile) investors who feel they must “get aboard”. The game is dignified, of course, by appropriate ceremonies,
personages and lexicon. To date it has been highly profitable. It may also be that this is going to be the standard
nature of the market in the future. Nevertheless, it is an activity at which I am sure I would not do particularly
well. As I said on page five of my last annual letter,

        "Furthermore, we will not follow the frequently prevalent approach of investing in securities where an
        attempt to anticipate market action overrides business valuations. Such so-called 'fashion' investing has
        frequently produced very substantial and quick profits in recent years (and currently as I write this in
        January). It represents an investment technique whose soundness I can neither affirm nor deny. It does
        not completely satisfy my intellect (or perhaps my prejudices), and most definitely does not fit my
        temperament. I will not invest my own money based upon such an approach – hence, I will most
        certainly not do so with your money.”

Any form of hyper-activity with large amounts of money in securities markets can create problems for all
participants. I make no attempt to guess the action of the stock market and haven't the foggiest notion as to
whether the Dow will be at 600, 900 or 1200 a year from now. Even if there are serious consequences resulting
from present and future speculative activity, experience suggests estimates of timing are meaningless. However,
I do believe certain conditions that now exist are likely to make activity in markets more difficult for us for the
intermediate future.

The above may simply be "old-fogeyism" (after all, I am 37). When the game is no longer being played your
way, it is only human to say the new approach is all wrong, bound to lead to trouble, etc. I have been scornful of
such behavior by others in the past. I have also seen the penalties incurred by those who evaluate conditions as


                                                                                                                112
they were - not as they are. Essentially I am out of step with present conditions. On one point, however, I am
clear. I will not abandon a previous approach whose logic I understand (although I find it difficult to apply) even
though it may mean foregoing large and apparently easy, profits to embrace an approach which I don’t fully
understand, have not practiced successfully and which, possibly, could lead to substantial permanent loss of
capital.

The third point of difficulty involves our much greater base of capital. For years my investment ideas were
anywhere from 110% to 1000% of our capital. It was difficult for me to conceive that a different condition could
ever exist. I promised to tell partners when it did and in my January, 1967 letter had to make good on that
promise. Largely because of the two conditions previously mentioned, our greater capital is now something of a
drag on performance. I believe it is the least significant factor of the four mentioned, and that if we were
operating with one-tenth of our present capital our performance would be little better. However, increased funds
are presently a moderately negative factor.

The final, and most important, consideration concerns personal motivation. When I started the partnership I set
the motor that regulated the treadmill at "ten points better than the DOW". I was younger, poorer and probably
more competitive. Even without the three previously discussed external factors making for poorer performance.
I would still feel that changed personal conditions make it advisable to reduce the speed of the treadmill. I have
observed many cases of habit patterns in all activities of life, particularly business, continuing (and becoming
accentuated as years pass) long after they ceased making sense. Bertrand Russell has related the story of two
Lithuanian girls who lived at his manor subsequent to World War I. Regularly each evening after the house was
dark, they would sneak out and steal vegetables from the neighbors for hoarding in their rooms; this despite the
fact that food was bountiful at the Russell table. Lord Russell explained to the girls that while such behavior
may have made a great deal of sense in Lithuania during the war, it was somewhat out of place in the English
countryside. He received assenting nods and continued stealing.

He finally contented himself with the observation that their behavior, strange as it might seem to the neighbors,
was really not so different from that of the elder Rockefeller.

Elementary self-analysis tells me that I will not be capable of less than all-out effort to achieve a publicly
proclaimed goal to people who have entrusted their capital to me. All-out effort makes progressively less sense.
I would like to have an economic goal which allows for considerable non-economic activity. This may mean
activity outside the field of investments or it simply may mean pursuing lines within the investment field that do
not promise the greatest economic reward. An example of the latter might be the continued investment in a
satisfactory (but far from spectacular) controlled business where I liked the people and the nature of the business
even though alternative investments offered an expectable higher rate of return. More money would be made
buying businesses at attractive prices, then reselling them. However, it may be more enjoyable (particularly
when the personal value of incremental capital is less) to continue to own them and hopefully improve their
performance, usually in a minor way, through some decisions involving financial strategy.

Thus, I am likely to limit myself to things which are reasonably easy, safe, profitable and pleasant. This will not
make our operation more conservative than in the past since I believe, undoubtedly with some bias, that we have
always operated with considerable conservatism. The long-term downside risk will not be less; the upside
potential will merely be less.

Specifically, our longer term goal will be to achieve the lesser of 9% per annum or a five percentage point
advantage over the Dow. Thus, if the Dow averages -2% over the next five years, I would hope to average +3%
but if the Dow averages +12%, I will hope to achieve an average of only +9%. These may be limited objectives,
but I consider it no more likely that we will achieve even these more modest results under present conditions
than I formerly did that we would achieve our previous goal of a ten percentage point average annual edge over
the Dow. Furthermore, I hope limited objectives will make for more limited effort (I'm quite sure the converse is


                                                                                                               113
true).

I will incorporate this new goal into the Ground Rules to be mailed you about November 1, along with the 1968
Commitment Letter. I wanted to get this letter off to you prior to that mailing so you would have ample time to
consider your personal situation, and if necessary get in touch with me to clear up some of the enclosed, before
making a decision on 1968. As always, I intend to continue to leave virtually all of my capital (excluding Data
Documents stock), along with that of my family, in BPL. What I consider satisfactory and achievable may well
be different from what you consider so. Partners with attractive alternative investment opportunities may
logically decide that their funds can be better employed elsewhere, and you can be sure I will be wholly in
sympathy with such a decision.

I have always found behavior most distasteful which publicly announces one set of goals and motivations when
actually an entirely different set of factors prevails. Therefore, I have always tried to be l00% candid with you
about my goals and personal feelings so you aren't making important decisions pursuant to phony proclamations
(I've run into a few of these in our investment experience). Obviously all the conditions enumerated in this letter
haven't appeared overnight. I have been thinking about some of the points involved for a long period of time.
You can understand, I am sure, that I wanted to pick a time when past goals had been achieved to set forth a
reduction in future goals. I would not want to reduce the speed of the treadmill unless I had fulfilled my
objectives to this point.

Please let me know if I can be of any help in deciphering any portion of this letter.

Our Performance in 1967

By most standards, we had a good year in 1967. Our overall performance was plus 35.9% compared to plus
19.0% for the Dow, thus surpassing our previous objective of performance ten points superior to the Dow. Our
overall gain was $19,384,250 which, even under accelerating inflation, will buy a lot of Pepsi. And, due to the
sale of some longstanding large positions in marketable securities, we had realized taxable income of
$27,376,667 which has nothing to do with 1967 performance but should give all of you a feeling of vigorous
participation in The Great Society on April 15th.

The minor thrills described above are tempered by any close observation of what really took place in the stock
market during 1967. Probably a greater percentage of participants in the securities markets did substantially
better than the Dow last year than in virtually any year in history. In 1967, for many, it rained gold and it paid to
be out playing the bass tuba. I don't have a final tabulation at this time but my guess is that at least 95% of
investment companies following a common stock program achieved better results than the Dow - in many cases
by very substantial amounts. It was a year when profits achieved were in inverse proportion to age - and I am in
the geriatric ward, philosophically.

The following summarizes the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the Partnership before allocation (one
quarter of the excess over 6%) to the general partner, and the results for limited partners:

        “A few mutual funds and some private investment operations have compiled records vastly superior to
        the Dow and, in some cases, substantially superior to Buffett Partnership, Ltd. Their investment
        techniques are usually very dissimilar to ours and not within my capabilities.”

In 1967 this condition intensified. Many investment organizations performed substantially better than BPL, with
gains ranging to over 100%. Because of these spectacular results, money, talent and energy are converging in a
maximum effort for the achievement of large and quick stock market profits. It looks to me like greatly
intensified speculation with concomitant risks -but many of the advocates insist otherwise.

My mentor, Ben Graham, used to say. “Speculation is neither illegal, immoral nor fattening (financially).”
During the past year, it was possible to become fiscally flabby through a steady diet of speculative bonbons. We
continue to eat oatmeal but if indigestion should set in generally, it is unrealistic to expect that we won’t have
some discomfort.

Analysis of 1967 Results

The overall figures given earlier conceal vast differences in profitability by portfolio category during 1967.

We had our worst performance in history in the “Workout” section. In the 1965 letter, this category was defined
as,
       “...securities with a timetable. They arise from corporate activity -- sell-outs, mergers, reorganizations,
       spin-offs, etc. In this category, we are not talking about rumors or inside information pertaining to such
       developments, but to publicly announced activities of this sort. We wait until we can read it in the paper.
       The risk does not pertain primarily to general market behavior (although that is sometimes tied in. to a
       degree). but instead to something upsetting the applecart so that the expected corporate development
       does not materialize.”

The streets were filled with upset applecarts - our applecarts - during 1967. Thus, on an average investment of
$17,246,879, our overall gain was $153,273. For those of you whose slide rule does not go to such insulting
depths, this represents a return of .89 of 1%. While I don't have complete figures. I doubt that we have been
below 10% in any past year. As in other categories, we tend to concentrate our investments in the workout
category in just a few situations per year. This technique gives more variation in yearly results than would be the
case if we used an across-the-board approach. I believe our approach will result in as great (or greater)
profitability on a long-term basis, but you can't prove it by 1967.

Our investment in controlled companies was a similar drag on relative performance in 1967, but this is to be
expected in strong markets. On an average investment of $20,192,776 we had an overall gain of $2,894,571. I
am pleased with this sort of performance, even though this category will continue to underperform if the market
continues strong during 1968. Through our two controlled companies (Diversified Retailing and Berkshire
Hathaway), we acquired two new enterprises in 1967. Associated Cotton Shops and National Indemnity (along
with National Fire & Marine, an affiliated company). These acquisitions couldn't be more gratifying. Everything
was as advertised or better. The principal selling executives, Ben Rosner and Jack Ringwalt, have continued to
do a superb job (the only kind they know), and in every respect have far more than lived up to their end of the
bargain.

The satisfying nature of our activity in controlled companies is a minor reason for the moderated investment
objectives discussed in the October 9th letter. When I am dealing with people I like, in businesses I find
stimulating (what business isn't ?), and achieving worthwhile overall returns on capital employed (say, 10 -
12%), it seems foolish to rush from situation to situation to earn a few more percentage points. It also does not
seem sensible to me to trade known pleasant personal relationships with high grade people, at a decent rate of


                                                                                                                 117
return, for possible irritation, aggravation or worse at potentially higher returns. Hence, we will continue to keep
a portion of our capital (but not over 40% because of the possible liquidity requirements arising from the nature
of our partnership agreement) invested in controlled operating businesses at an expected rate of return below
that inherent in an aggressive stock market operation.

With a combined total of $37,439,655 in workouts and controls producing an overall gain of only $3,047,844,
the more alert members of the class will have already concluded we had a whale of a year in the "Generals -
Relatively Undervalued" category. On a net average investment of $19,487,996, we had an overall gain of
$14,096,593, or 72%. Last year I referred to one investment which substantially outperformed the general
market in 1964, 1965 and 1966 and because of its size (the largest proportion we have ever had in anything - we
hit our 40% limit) had a very material impact on our overall results and, even more so, this category. This
excellent performance continued throughout 1967 and a large portion of total gain was again accounted for by
this single security. Our holdings of this security have been very substantially reduced and we have nothing in
this group remotely approaching the size or potential which formerly existed in this investment.

The "Generals - Private Owner" section produced good results last year ($1,297,215 on $5,141,710 average
investment), and we have some mildly interesting possibilities in this area at present.

Miscellaneous

We begin the new year with net assets of $68,108,088. We had partners with capital of about $1,600,000
withdraw at yearend, primarily because of the reduced objectives announced in the October 9th letter. This
makes good sense for them, since most of them have the ability and motivation to surpass our objectives and I
am relieved from pushing for results that I probably can't attain under present conditions.

Some of those who withdrew (and many who didn't) asked me, "What do you really mean?" after receiving the
October 9th letter. This sort of a question is a little bruising to any author, but I assured them I meant exactly
what I had said. I was also asked whether this was an initial stage in the phasing out of the partnership. The
answer to this is, “Definitely, no”. As long as partners want to put up their capital alongside of mine and the
business is operationally pleasant (and it couldn't be better), I intend to continue to do business with those who
have backed me since tennis shoes.

Gladys Kaiser has joined us and is doing the same sort of top-notch job that we have long received from Donna,
Bill and John. The office group, spouses and children have over $15 million invested in BPL on January 1,
1968, so we have not had a need for NoDoz during business hours.

Within a few days, you will receive:

    1. A tax letter giving you all BPL information needed for your 1967 federal income tax return. This letter
       is the only item that counts for tax purposes.

    2. An audit from Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. (they have again done an excellent job) for 1967, setting
       forth the operations and financial position of BPL, as well as your own capital account.

    3. A letter signed by me setting forth the status of your BPL interest on January 1, 1968. This is identical
       with the figures developed in the audit.

Let me know if anything in this letter or that occurs during the year needs clarifying. My next letter will be
about July15th, summarizing the first half of this year.

Cordially,


                                                                                                                 118

First Half Performance

During the first half of 1968, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average declined fractionally from 905 to 898.
Ownership of the Dow would also have produced dividends of about $15 during the half, resulting in an overall
gain of 0.9% for that Average. The Dow, once again, was an anemic competitor for most investment managers,
although it was not surpassed by anything like the margins of 1967.

Our own performance was unusually good during the first half, with an overall gain of 16% excluding any
change in valuation for controlled companies (which represented slightly over one-third of net assets at the
beginning of the year). However, any release of adrenalin is unwarranted. Our marketable security investments
are heavily concentrated in a few situations, making relative performance potentially more volatile than in
widely diversified investment vehicles. Our long term performance goals are as stated in the revised "Ground
Rules" and I will be quite happy if we achieve those limited objectives over a period of years. The following
table summarizes performance to date on the usual basis:

Although we revise valuations of our controlled companies only at yearend, it presently appears that our share of
their 1968 earnings will be something over $3 million. Those with primary responsibility for their operations,
Ken Chace at Berkshire Hathaway, Louis Kohn at Hochschild Kohn, Jack Ringwalt at National Indemnity and
Ben Rosner at Associated Cotton Shops, continue to meld effort and ability into results.

This year, Diversified Retailing Company (owner of Hochschild Kohn and Associated Cotton Shops) issued its
first published annual report. This was occasioned by the public sale of debentures to approximately 1,000
investors last December. Thus, DRC is in the rather unusual position of being a public company from a
creditors' viewpoint, but a private one (there are three stockholders -BPL owns 80%) for ownership purposes. I
am enclosing the DRC report with this letter (except where duplicates go to one house hold) and plan to
continue to send them along with future mid-year letters.

As I have mentioned before, we cannot make the same sort of money out of permanent ownership of controlled
businesses that can be made from buying and reselling such businesses, or from skilled investment in
marketable securities. Nevertheless, they offer a pleasant long term form of activity (when conducted in
conjunction with high grade, able people) at satisfactory rates of return.

The Present Environment



                                                                                                             121
I make no effort to predict the course of general business or the stock market. Period. However, currently there
are practices snowballing in the security markets and business world which, while devoid of short term
predictive value, bother me as to possible long term consequences.

I know that some of you are not particularly interested (and shouldn't be) in what is taking place on the financial
stage. For those who are, I am enclosing a reprint of an unusually clear and simple article which lays bare just
what is occurring on a mushrooming scale. Spectacular amounts of money are being made by those participating
(whether as originators, top employees. professional advisors, investment bankers, stock speculators, etc… ) in
the chain-letter type stock-promotion vogue. The game is being played by the gullible, the self-hypnotized, and
the cynical. To create the proper illusions, it frequently requires accounting distortions (one particularly
progressive entrepreneur told me he believed in "bold, imaginative accounting"), tricks of capitalization and
camouflage of the true nature of the operating businesses involved. The end product is popular, respectable and
immensely profitable (I'll let the philosophers figure in which order those adjectives should be placed).

Quite candidly, our own performance has been substantially improved on an indirect basis because of the fall-
out from such activities. To create an ever widening circle of chain letters requires increasing amounts of
corporate raw material and this has caused many intrinsically cheap (and not so cheap) stocks to come to life.
When we have been the owners of such stocks, we have reaped market rewards much more promptly than might
otherwise have been the case. The appetite for such companies, however, tends to substantially diminish the
number of fundamentally attractive investments which remain.

I believe the odds are good that, when the stock market and business history of this period is being written, the
phenomenon described in Mr. May's article will be regarded as of major importance, and perhaps characterized
as a mania. You should realize, however, that his "The Emperor Has No Clothes" approach is at odds (or
dismissed with a “SO What?” or an "Enjoy, Enjoy”) with the views of most investment banking houses and
currently successful investment managers. We live in an investment world, populated not by those who must be
logically persuaded to believe, but by the hopeful, credulous and greedy, grasping for an excuse to believe.

Finally, for a magnificent account of the current financial scene, you should hurry out and get a copy of “The
Money Game” by Adam Smith. It is loaded with insights and supreme wit. (Note: Despite my current “Support
Your Local Postmaster” drive, I am not enclosing the book with this letter - it retails for $6.95.)

Taxes

Several unusual factors make the tax figure even more difficult than usual to estimate this year. We will
undoubtedly have an above average amount of ordinary income. The picture on short term and long term capital
gain is subject to unusually substantial variance. At the beginning of the year, I suggested that you use an 8%
ordinary income factor (it won't come in this manner but this figure embodies an adjustment for long term
capital gain) applied to your BPL capital account on an interim basis to compute quarterly tax estimates. If a
figure different from 8% seems more appropriate for your September 15th quarterly estimate. I will let you
know by September 5th. If no change is necessary, you will next hear from me on November 1st with the
Commitment Letter for
