My closing plea for questions regarding anything not clear always draws a blank. Maybe no one reads this far.
Anyway, the offer is still open.

To My Partners for 1964:

Enclosed is the usual assortment of Thanksgiving reading material:

    (1) Two copies of an amended partnership agreement for 1964. The one with the General Provisions
        attached is to be kept by you (exactly the same as last year) and the other single page agreement is to be
        signed, notarized and returned to us. Partners in Omaha may come in and obtain the notarization at our
        office.

    (2) A copy of that priceless treatise, "The Ground Rules,” I would like every partner to read this at least
        once a year, and it is going to be a regular item in my November package. Don't sign the partnership
        agreement unless you fully understand the concepts set forth and are in accord with them -- mentally
        and viscerally.

    (3) Two copies of the commitment letter for 1964, one to be kept by you and one returned to us. You may
        amend this commitment letter right up to midnight, December 31st, so get it back to us early, and if it
        needs to be changed, just let us know by letter or phone.

Any withdrawals will be paid immediately after January 1st. You may withdraw any amount you desire from
$100 up to your entire equity. Similarly, additions can be for any amount and should reach us by January 10th.
In the event you are disposing of anything, this will give you a chance to have the transaction in 1964 if that
appears to be advantageous for tax reasons. If additions reach us in November, they take on the status of
advance payments and draw interest at the rate of 6% until yearend. This is not true of additions reaching us in
December.

Complete tax information for your 1963 return will be in your hands by January 25th. If you should need an
estimate of your tax position before that time, let me know and I will give you a rough idea. We will also send
out a short letter on taxes in late December.

At the end of October, the overall result from the Dow for 1963 was plus 18.8%. We have had a good year in all
three categories, generals, work-outs and controls. A satisfactory sale on a going concern basis of Dempster Mill
Manufacturing operating assets was made about a month ago. I will give the full treatment to the Dempster story
in the annual letter, perhaps climaxed by some lyrical burst such as “Ode to Harry Bottle.” While we always had
a built-in profit in Dempster because of our bargain purchase price, Harry accounted for several extra servings
of dessert by his extraordinary job. Harry, incidentally, has made an advance payment toward becoming a
limited partner in 1964-- we consider this the beginning, not the end.

However, 1963 has not been all Dempster. While a great deal can happen the last two months and therefore
interim results should not be taken too seriously, at the end of October the overall gain for the partnership was
about 32%. Based on the allocation embodied in our agreement, this works out to plus 25 1/2% for the limited
partners before monthly payments to those who take them. Of our approximate $3 million gain, something over
$2 million came from marketable securities and a little less than $1 million from Dempster operating assets. The
combined gain from our single best general and best work-out situation approximated the gain on the Dempster
operating assets.



                                                                                                                  49
You should be aware that if our final results relative to the Dow for 1963 are as favorable as on October 31st, I
will regard it as an abnormal year. I do not consider a 13.2 percentage point margin to be in the cards on a long
term basis. A considerably more moderate annual edge over the Dow will be quite satisfactory.

Cordially

P/S. Last year we announced there would be no prizes for the last ones to get the material back to us. This
continues to be our policy. Save us some last minute scurrying by getting your agreement and commitment letter
back pronto. Give Bill or me a call if we can be of any help. Thanks!

Our Performance in 1963

1963 was a good year. It was not a good year because we had an overall gain of $3,637,167 or 38.7% on our
beginning net assets, pleasant as that experience may be to the pragmatists in our group. Rather it was a good
year because our performance was substantially better than that of our fundamental yardstick --the Dow-Jones
Industrial Average (hereinafter called the “Dow”). If we had been down 20% and the Dow had been down 30%,
this letter would still have begun “1963 was a good year.” Regardless of whether we are plus or minus in a
particular year, if we can maintain a satisfactory edge on the Dow over an extended period of time, our long
term results will be satisfactory -- financially as well as philosophically.

To bring the record up to date, the following summarizes the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the
performance of the Partnership before allocation to the general partner, and the limited partners' results for all
full years of BPL's and predecessor partnerships' activities:

         Year               Overall Results From        Partnership Results          Limited Partners’
                                  Dow (1)                       (2)                     Results (3)
         1957                       -8.4%                     10.4%                        9.3%
         1958                      38.5%                      40.9%                       32.2%
         1959                      20.0%                      25.9%                       20.9%

        (1) Based on yearly changes in the value of the Dow plus dividends that would have been received
            through ownership of the Dow during that year.

        (2) For 1957-61 consists of combined results of all predecessor limited partnerships operating
            throughout the entire year after all expenses but before distributions to partners or allocations to the
            general partner.

        (3) For 1957-61 computed on the basis of the preceding column of partnership results allowing for
            allocation to the general partner based upon the present partnership agreement.

One wag among the limited partners has suggested I add a fourth column showing the results of the general
partner --let's just say he, too, has an edge on the Dow.

The following table shows the cumulative or compounded results based on the preceding table:

It appears that we have completed seven fat years. With apologies to Joseph we shall attempt to ignore the
biblical script. (I've never gone overboard for Noah's ideas on diversification either.)

In a more serious vein, I would like to emphasize that, in my judgment; our 17.7 margin over the Dow shown
above is unattainable over any long period of time. A ten percentage point advantage would be a very
satisfactory accomplishment and even a much more modest edge would produce impressive gains as will be
touched upon later. This view (and it has to be guesswork -- informed or otherwise) carries with it the corollary
that we must expect prolonged periods of much narrower margins over the Dow as well as at least occasional
years when our record will be inferior (perhaps substantially so) to the Dow.

Much of the above sermon is reflected in "The Ground Rules" sent to everyone in November, but it can stand
repetition.

Investment Companies

We regularly compare our results with the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that
follow a policy of being, typically, 95 -100% invested in common stocks, and the two largest diversified closed-
end investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, Tri-
Continental Corp. and Lehman Corp. manage about $4 billion and are probably typical of most of the $25
billion investment company industry. My opinion is that their results roughly parallel those of the vast majority
or other investment advisory organizations which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

The purpose or this tabulation, which is shown below, is to illustrate that the Dow is no pushover as an index or
investment achievement. The advisory talent managing just the four companies shown commands' annual fees
of over $7 million, and this represents a very small fraction of the industry. The public batting average of this
highly-paid talent indicates they achieved results slightly less favorable than the Dow.

Both our portfolio and method of operation differ substantially from the investment companies in the table.
However, most partners, as an alternative to their interest in the Partnership would probably have their funds
invested in media producing results comparable with investment companies, and I, therefore, feel they offer a
meaningful standard of performance.

The Dow, of course, is an unmanaged index, and it may seem strange to the reader to contemplate the high
priests of Wall Street striving vainly to surpass or even equal it. However, this is demonstrably the case.
Moreover, such a failure cannot be rationalized by the assumption that the investment companies et al are
handling themselves in a more conservative manner than the Dow. As the table above indicates, and as more
extensive studies bear out, the behavior of common stock portfolio managed by this group, on average, have
declined in concert with the Dow. By such a test of behavior in declining markets, our own methods of
operation have proven to be considerably more conservative than the common stock component of the
investment company or investment advisor group. While this has been true in the past, there obviously can be no
guarantees about the future.

The above may seem like rather strong medicine, but it is offered as a factual presentation and in no way as
criticism. Within their institutional framework and handling the many billions of dollars involved, the results
achieved are the only ones attainable. To behave unconventionally within this framework is extremely difficult.
Therefore, the collective record of such investment media is necessarily tied to the record of corporate America.
Their merits, except in the unusual case, do not lie in superior results or greater resistance to decline in value.
Rather, I feel they earn their keep by the ease of handling, the freedom from decision making and the automatic
diversification they provide, plus, perhaps most important, the insulation afforded from temptation to practice
patently inferior techniques which seem to entice so many world-be investors.

The Joys of Compounding

Now to the pulse-quickening portion of our essay. Last year, in order to drive home the point on compounding, I
took a pot shot at Queen Isabella and her financial advisors. You will remember they were euchred into such an
obviously low-compound situation as the discovery of a new hemisphere.

Since the whole subject of compounding has such a crass ring to it, I will attempt to introduce a little class into
this discussion by turning to the art world. Francis I of France paid 4,000 ecus in 1540 for Leonardo da Vinci’s
Mona Lisa. On the off chance that a few of you have not kept track of the fluctuations of the ecu 4,000
converted out to about $20,000.

If Francis had kept his feet on the ground and he (and his trustees) had been able to find a 6% after-tax



                                                                                                                  53
investment, the estate now would be worth something over $1,000,000,000,000,000.00. That's $1 quadrillion or
over 3,000 times the present national debt, all from 6%. I trust this will end all discussion in our household
about any purchase or paintings qualifying as an investment.

However, as I pointed out last year, there are other morals to be drawn here. One is the wisdom of living a long
time. The other impressive factor is the swing produced by relatively small changes in the rate of compound.

Below are shown the gains from $100,000 compounded at various rates:

                             4%                     8%                   12%                    16%
     10 Years                  $48,024               $115,892              $210,584               $341,143
     20 Years                 $119,111               $366,094              $864,627              $1,846,060
     30 Years                 $224,337               $906,260             $2,895,970             $8,484,940

It is obvious that a variation of merely a few percentage points has an enormous effect on the success of a
compounding (investment) program. It is also obvious that this effect mushrooms as the period lengthens. If,
over a meaningful period of time, Buffett Partnership can achieve an edge of even a modest number of
percentage points over the major investment media, its function will be fulfilled.

Some of you may be downcast because I have not included in the above table the rate of 22.3% mentioned on
page 3. This rate, of course, is before income taxes which are paid directly by you --not the Partnership. Even
excluding this factor, such a calculation would only prove the absurdity of the idea of compounding at very high
rates -- even with initially modest sums. My opinion is that the Dow is quite unlikely to compound for any
important length of time at the rate it has during the past seven years and, as mentioned earlier, I believe our
margin over the Dow cannot be maintained at its level to date. The product of these assumptions would be a
materially lower average rate of compound for BPL in the future than the rate achieved to date. Injecting a
minus 30% year (which is going to happen from time to time) into our tabulation of actual results to date, with,
say, a corresponding minus 40% for the Dow brings both the figures on the Dow and BPL more in line with
longer range possibilities. As the compounding table above suggests, such a lowered rate can still provide highly
satisfactory long term investment results.

Our Method of Operation

At this point I always develop literary schizophrenia. On the one hand, I know that we have in the audience a
number of partners to whom details of our business are interesting. We also have a number to whom this whole
thing is Greek and who undoubtedly wish I would quit writing and get back to work.

To placate both camps, I am just going to sketch briefly our three categories at this point and those who are
interested in getting their doctorate can refer to the appendix for extended treatment of examples.

Our three investment categories are not differentiated by their expected profitability over an extended period of
time. We are hopeful that they will each, over a ten or fifteen year period, produce something like the ten
percentage point margin over the Dow that is our goal. However, in a given year they will have violently
different behavior characteristics, depending primarily on the type of year it turns out to be for the stock market
generally. Briefly this is how they shape up:

        “Generals” - A category of generally undervalued stocks, determined primarily by quantitative
        standards, but with considerable attention also paid to the qualitative factor. There is often little or
        nothing to indicate immediate market improvement. The issues lack glamour or market sponsorship.
        Their main qualification is a bargain price; that is, an overall valuation on the enterprise substantially
        below what careful analysis indicates its value to a private owner to be. Again let me emphasize that


                                                                                                                     54
while the quantitative comes first and is essential, the qualitative is important. We like good
management - we like a decent industry - we like a certain amount of “ferment” in a previously dormant
management or stockholder group. But we demand value. The general group behaves very much in
sympathy with the Dow and will turn in a big minus result during a year of substantial decline by the
Dow. Contrarywise, it should be the star performer in a strongly advancing market. Over the years we
expect it, of course, to achieve a satisfactory margin over the Dow.

“Workouts” - These are the securities with a timetable. They arise from corporate activity - sell-outs,
mergers, reorganizations, spin-offs, etc. In this category we are not talking about rumors or "inside
information" pertaining to such developments, but to publicly announced activities of this sort. We wait
until we can read it in the paper. The risk pertains not primarily to general market behavior (although
that is sometimes tied in to a degree), but instead to something upsetting the applecart so that the
expected development does not materialize. Such killjoys could include anti-trust or other negative
government action, stockholder disapproval, withholding of tax rulings, etc. The gross profits in many
workouts appear quite small. A friend refers to this as getting the last nickel after the other fellow has
made the first ninety-five cents. However, the predictability coupled with a short holding period
produces quite decent annual rates of return. This category produces more steady absolute profits from
year to year than generals do. In years of market decline, it piles up a big edge for us; during bull
markets, it is a drag on performance. On a long term basis, I expect it to achieve the same sort of margin
over the Dow attained by generals.

“Controls” - These are rarities, but when they occur they are likely to be of significant size. Unless we
start off with the purchase of a sizable block or stock, controls develop from the general category. They
result from situations where a cheap security does nothing price-wise for such an extended period of
time that we are able to buy a significant percentage of the company's stock. At that point we are
probably in a position to assume some degree of, or perhaps complete, control of the company's
activities; whether we become active or remain relatively passive at this point depends upon our
assessment of the company’s future and the management's capabilities. The general we have been
buying the most aggressively in recent months possesses excellent management following policies that
appear to make very good sense to us. If our continued buying puts us in a controlling position at some
point in the future, we will probably remain very passive regarding the operation or this business.

We do not want to get active merely for the sake of being active. Everything else being equal I would
much rather let others do the work. However, when an active role is necessary to optimize the
employment of capital you can be sure we will not be standing in the wings.

Active or passive, in a control situation there should be a built-in profit. The sine qua non of this
operation is an attractive purchase price. Once control is achieved, the value of our investment is
determined by the value of the enterprise, not the oftentimes irrationalities of the marketplace.

Our willingness and financial ability to assume a controlling position gives us two-way stretch on many
purchases in our group of generals. If the market changes its opinion for the better, the security will
advance in price. If it doesn't, we will continue to acquire stock until we can look to the business itself
rather than the market for vindication of our judgment.

Investment results in the control category have to be measured on the basis of at least several years.
Proper buying takes time. If needed, strengthening management, re-directing the utilization of capital,
perhaps effecting a satisfactory sale or merger, etc., are also all factors that make this a business to be
measured in years rather than months. For this reason, in controls, we are looking for wide margins of
profit-if it looks at all close, we pass.



                                                                                                              55
        Controls in the buying stage move largely in sympathy with the Dow. In the later stages their behavior
        is geared more to that of workouts.

As I have mentioned in the past, the division of our portfolio among the three categories is largely determined
by the accident or availability. Therefore, in a minus year for the Dow, whether we are primarily in generals or
workouts is largely a matter of luck, but it will have a great deal to do with our performance relative to the Dow.
This is one or many reasons why a single year's performance is of minor importance and, good or bad, should
never be taken too seriously.

If there is any trend as our assets grow, I would expect it to be toward controls which heretofore have been our
smallest category. I may be wrong in this expectation - a great deal depends, of course, on the future behavior of
the market on which your guess is as good as mine (I have none). At this writing, we have a majority of our
capital in generals, workouts rank second, and controls are third.

Miscellaneous

We are starting off the year with net assets of $17,454,900. Our rapid increase in assets always raises the
question of whether this will result in a dilution of future performance. To date, there is more of a positive than
inverse correlation between size of the Partnership and its margin over the Dow. This should not be taken
seriously however. Larger sums may be an advantage at some times and a disadvantage at others. My opinion is
that our present portfolio could not be improved if our assets were $1 million or $5 million. Our idea inventory
has always seemed to be 10% ahead of our bank account. If that should change, you can count on hearing from
me.

Susie and I have an investment of $2,392,900 in the Partnership. For the first time I had to withdraw funds in
addition to my monthly payments, but it was a choice of this or disappointing the Internal Revenue Service.
Susie and I have a few non-marketable (less than 300 holders) securities of nominal size left over from earlier
years which in aggregate are worth perhaps 1% of our partnership interest. In addition we have one non-
marketable holding of more material size of a local company purchased in 1960 which we expect to hold
indefinitely. Aside from this all our eggs are in the BPL basket and they will continue to be. I can't promise
results but I can promise a common destiny. In addition, that endless stream of relatives of mine consisting of
my three children, mother, father, two sisters, two brothers-in-law, father-in-law, four aunts four cousins and
five nieces and nephews, have interests in BPL directly or indirectly totaling $1,247,190.

Bill Scott is also in with both feet, having an interest along with his wife or $237,400, the large majority or their
net worth. Bill has done an excellent job and on several or our more interesting situations going into 1964, he
has done the majority or the contact work. I have also shoved off on him as much as possible of the
administrative work so if you need anything done or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for Bill if I'm not
around.

Beth and Donna have kept an increasing work load flowing in an excellent manner. During December and
January, I am sure they wish they had found employment elsewhere, but they always manage to keep a
mountain of work ship-shape.

Peat, Marwick, Mitchell has done their usual excellent job of meeting a tough timetable. We have instructed
them to conduct two surprise checks a year (rather than one as in past years) on our securities, cash, etc., in the
future. These are relatively inexpensive, and I think make a good deal of sense in any financial organization.

Within the next week you will receive:

    (1) A tax letter giving you all BPL information needed for your 1963 federal income tax return. This letter


                                                                                                                   56
        is the only item that counts for tax purposes.

    (2) An audit from Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. for 1963, setting forth the operations and financial
        position of BPL as well as your own capital account.

    (3) A letter signed by me setting forth the status of your BPL interest on 1/1/64. This is identical with the
        figure developed in the audit.

    (4) Schedule “A” to the partnership agreement listing all partners.

Let me know if anything needs clarifying. As we grow, there is more chance of missing letters, a name skipped
over, a figure transposition, etc., so speak up if it appears we might have erred. Our next letter will be about July
15th summarizing the first half.

Cordially,

Warren E. Buffett

TEXAS NATIONAL PETROLEUM

This situation was a run-of-the-mill workout arising from the number one source of workouts in recent years --
the sellouts of oil and gas producing companies.

TNP was a relatively small producer with which I had been vaguely familiar for years.

Early in 1962 I heard rumors regarding a sellout to Union Oil of California. I never act on such information, but
in this case it was correct and substantially more money would have been made if we had gone in at the rumor
stage rather than the announced stage. However, that's somebody else's business, not mine.

In early April, 1962, the general terms of the deal were announced. TNP had three classes of securities
outstanding:

    (1) 6 1/2% debentures callable at 104 1/4 which would bear interest until the sale transpired and at that time
        would be called. There were $6.5 million outstanding of which we purchased $264,000 principal
        amount before the sale closed.

    (2) About 3.7 million shares of common stock of which the officers and directors owned about 40%. The
        proxy statement estimated the proceeds from the liquidation would produce $7.42 per share. We
        purchased 64,035 shares during the six months or so between announcement and closing.

    (3) 650,000 warrants to purchase common stock at $3.50 per share. Using the proxy statement estimate of
        $7.42 for the workout on the common resulted in $3.92 as a workout on the warrants. We were able to
        buy 83,200 warrants or about 13% of the entire issue in six months.

The risk of stockholder disapproval was nil. The deal was negotiated by the controlling stockholders, and the
price was a good one. Any transaction such as this is subject to title searches, legal opinions, etc., but this risk
could also be appraised at virtually nil. There were no anti-trust problems. This absence of legal or anti-trust
problems is not always the case, by any means.

The only fly in the ointment was the obtaining of the necessary tax ruling. Union Oil was using a standard ABC
production payment method of financing. The University of Southern California was the production payment
holder and there was some delay because of their eleemosynary status.

This posed a new problem for the Internal Revenue Service, but we understood USC was willing to waive this
status which still left them with a satisfactory profit after they borrowed all the money from a bank. While
getting this ironed out created delay, it did not threaten the deal.

When we talked with the company on April 23rd and 24th, their estimate was that the closing would take place
in August or September. The proxy material was mailed May 9th and stated the sale "will be consummated
during the summer of 1962 and that within a few months thereafter the greater part of the proceeds will be
distributed to stockholders in liquidation.” As mentioned earlier, the estimate was $7.42 per share.
Bill Scott attended the stockholders meeting in Houston on May 29th where it was stated they still expected to
close on September 1st.

The following are excerpts from some of the telephone conversations we had with company officials in ensuing
months:



                                                                                                                       58
        On June 18th the secretary stated "Union has been told a favorable IRS ruling has been formulated but
        must be passed on by additional IRS people. Still hoping for ruling in July.”

        On July 24th the president said that he expected the IRS ruling “early next week.”

        On August 13th the treasurer informed us that the TNP, Union Oil, and USC people were all in
        Washington attempting to thrash out a ruling.

        On September 18th the treasurer informed us "No news, although the IRS says the ruling could be ready
        by next week.”

The estimate on payout was still $7.42.

The ruling was received in late September, and the sale closed October 31st. Our bonds were called November
13th. We converted our warrants to common stock shortly thereafter and received payments on the common of
$3.50 December 14, 1962, $3.90 February 4, 1963, and 15 cent on April 24, 1963. We will probably get another
4 cent in a year or two. On 147,235 shares (after exercise of warrants) even 4 cent per share is meaningful.

This illustrates the usual pattern: (1) the deals take longer than originally projected; and (2) the payouts tend to
average a little better than estimates. With TNP it took a couple of extra months, and we received a couple of
extra percent.

The financial results of TNP were as follows:

    (1) On the bonds we invested $260,773 and had an average holding period of slightly under five months.
        We received 6 ½% interest on our money and realized a capital gain of $14,446. This works out to an
        overall rate of return of approximately 20% per annum.

    (2) On the stock and warrants we have realized capital gain of $89,304, and we have stubs presently valued
        at $2,946. From an investment or $146,000 in April, our holdings ran to $731,000 in October. Based on
        the time the money was employed, the rate or return was about 22% per annum.

In both cases, the return is computed on an all equity investment. I definitely feel some borrowed money is
warranted against a portfolio of workouts, but feel it is a very dangerous practice against generals.

We are not presenting TNP as any earth-shaking triumph. We have had workouts which were much better and
some which were poorer. It is typical of our bread-and-butter type of operation. We attempt to obtain all facts
possible, continue to keep abreast of developments and evaluate all of this in terms of our experience. We
certainly don't go into all the deals that come along -- there is considerable variation in their attractiveness.
When a workout falls through, the resulting market value shrink is substantial. Therefore, you cannot afford
many errors, although we fully realize we are going to have them occasionally.

DEMPSTER MILL MFG.

This situation started as a general in 1956. At that time the stock was selling at $18 with about $72 in book value
of which $50 per share was in current assets (Cash, receivables and inventory) less all liabilities. Dempster had
earned good money in the past but was only breaking even currently.

The qualitative situation was on the negative side (a fairly tough industry and unimpressive management), but
the figures were extremely attractive. Experience shows you can buy 100 situations like this and have perhaps
70 or 80 work out to reasonable profits in one to three years. Just why any particular one should do so is hard to


                                                                                                                    59
say at the time of purchase, but the group expectancy is favorable, whether the impetus is from an improved
industry situation, a takeover offer, a change in investor psychology, etc.

We continued to buy the stock in small quantities for five years. During most or this period I was a director and
was becoming consistently less impressed with the earnings prospects under existing management. However, I
also became more familiar with the assets and operations and my evaluation of the quantitative factors remained
very favorable.

By mid-1961 we owned about 30% or Dempster (we had made several tender offers with poor results), but in
August and September 1961 made, several large purchases at $30.25 per share, which coupled with a
subsequent tender offer at the same price, brought our holding to over 70%. Our purchases over the previous
five years had been in the $16-$25 range.

On assuming control, we elevated the executive vice president to president to see what he would do unfettered
by the previous policies. The results were unsatisfactory and on April 23, 1962 we hired Harry Bottle as
president.

Harry was the perfect man for the job. I have recited his triumphs before and the accompanying comparative
balance sheets speak louder than any words in demonstrating the re-employment of capital.

Harry:

    (1) took the inventory from over $4 million (much of it slow moving) to under $1 million reducing carrying
        costs and obsolescence risks tremendously;

    (2) correspondingly freed up capital for marketable security purchases from which we gained over


                                                                                                                60
        $400,000

    (3) cut administration and selling expense from $150,000 to $75,000 per month;

    (4) cut factory overhead burden from $6 to $4.50 per direct labor hour;

    (5) closed the five branches operating unprofitably (leaving us with three good ones) and replaced them
        with more productive distributors;

    (6) cleaned up a headache at an auxiliary factory operation at Columbus, Nebraska;

    (7) eliminated jobbed lines tying up considerable money (which could be used profitably in securities)
        while producing no profits;

    (8) adjusted prices of repair parts, thereby producing an estimated $200,000 additional profit with virtually
        no loss of volume; and most important;

    (9) through these and many other steps, restored the earning capacity to a level commensurate with the
        capital employed.

In 1963, the heavy corporate taxes we were facing (Harry surprised me by the speed with which he had earned
up our tax loss carry-forward) coupled with excess liquid funds within the corporation compelled us to either in
some way de-incorporate or to sell the business.

We set out to do either one or the other before the end of 1963. De-incorporating had many problems but would
have, in effect, doubled earnings for our partners and also eliminated the problem of corporate capital gain tax
on Dempster securities.

At virtually the last minute, after several earlier deals had fallen through at reasonably advanced stages, a sale of
assets was made. Although there were a good many wrinkles to the sale, the net effect was to bring
approximately book value. This, coupled with the gain we have in our portfolio of marketable securities, gives
us a realization of about $80 per share. Dempster (now named First Beatrice Corp. - we sold the name to the
new Co.) is down to almost entirely cash and marketable securities now. On BPL's yearend audit, our First
Beatrice holdings were valued at asset value (with securities at market) less a $200,000 reserve for various
contingencies.

I might mention that we think the buyers will do very well with Dempster. They impress us as people of ability
and they have sound plans to expand the business and its profitability. We would have been quite happy to
operate Dempster on an unincorporated basis, but we are also quite happy to sell it for a reasonable price. Our
business is making excellent purchases -- not making extraordinary sales.

Harry works the same way I do -- he likes big carrots. He is presently a limited partner of BPL, and the next
belt-tightening operation we have, he's our man.

The Dempster saga points up several morals:

    (1) Our business is one requiring patience. It has little in common with a portfolio of high-flying glamour
        stocks and during periods of popularity for the latter, we may appear quite stodgy.

        It is to our advantage to have securities do nothing price wise for months, or perhaps years, why we are
        buying them. This points up the need to measure our results over an adequate period of time. We


                                                                                                                  61
    suggest three years as a minimum.

(2) We cannot talk about our current investment operations. Such an open-mouth policy could never
    improve our results and in some situations could seriously hurt us. For this reason, should anyone,
    including partners, ask us whether we are interested in any security, we must plead the “5th
    Amendment.”

First Half Performance

The whole family is leaving for California on June 23rd so I am fudging a bit on this report and writing it June
18th. However, for those of you who set your watches by the receipt of our letters. I will maintain our usual
chronological symmetry in reporting, leaving a few blanks which Bill will fill in after the final June 30th figures
are available.

During the first half of 1964 the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter called the “DOW”) advanced from
762.95 to 831.50. If one had owned the Dow during this period, dividends of approximately 14.40 would have
been received, bringing the overall return from the Dow during the first half to plus 10.0%. As I write this on
June 18th, it appears that our results will differ only insignificantly from those of the Dow. I would feel much
better reporting to you that the Dow had broken even, and we had been plus 5%, or better still, that the Dow had
been minus 10%, and we had broken even. I have always pointed out, however, that gaining an edge on the Dow
is more difficult for us in advancing markets than in static or declining ones.

To bring the record up to date, the following summarizes the performance of the Dow, the performance of the
Partnership before allocation to the general partner and the limited partners' results:

        allocation to the general partner based up on the present partnership agreement, but before monthly
        withdrawals by limited partners.

Buying activities during the first half were quite satisfactory. This is of particular satisfaction to me since I
consider the buying end to be about 90% of this business. Our General category now includes three companies
where B.P.L. is the largest single stockholder. These stocks have been bought and are continuing to be bought at
prices considerably below their value to a private owner. We have been buying one of these situations for
approximately eighteen months and both of the others for about a year. It would not surprise me if we continue
to do nothing but patiently buy these securities week after week for at least another year, and perhaps even two
years or more.

What we really like to see in situations like the three mentioned above is a condition where the company is
making substantial progress in terms of improving earnings, increasing asset values, etc., but where the market
price of the stock is doing very little while we continue to acquire it. This doesn't do much for our short-term
performance, particularly relative to a rising market, but it is a comfortable and logical producer of longer-term
profits. Such activity should usually result in either appreciation of market prices from external factors or the
acquisition by us of a controlling position in a business at a bargain price. Either alternative suits me.

It is important to realize, however, that most of our holdings in the General category continue to be securities
which we believe to be considerably undervalued, but where there is not the slightest possibility that we could
have a controlling position. We expect the market to justify our analyses of such situations in a reasonable
period of time, but we do not have the two strings to our bow mentioned in the above paragraph working for us
in these securities.

Investment Companies

We regularly compare our results with the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that
follow a policy of being typically 95%-100% invested in common stocks, and the two largest diversified closed-
end investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, Tri-
Continental Corp., and Lehman Corp., manage over $4 billion and are probably typical of most of the $28
billion investment company industry. Their results are shown below. My opinion is that this performance
roughly parallels that of the overwhelming majority of other investment advisory organizations which handle, in
aggregate, vastly greater sums.

These figures continue to show that the most highly paid and respected investment management has difficulty
matching the performance of an unmanaged index of blue chip stocks. The results of these companies in some
ways resemble the activity of a duck sitting on a pond. When the water (the market) rises, the duck rises; when it
falls, back goes the duck. SPCA or no SPCA, I think the duck can only take the credit (or blame) for his own
activities. The rise and fall of the lake is hardly something for him to quack about. The water level has been of
great importance to B.P.L’s performance as the table on page one indicates. However, we have also occasionally
flapped our wings.

I would like to emphasize that I am not saying that the Dow is the only way of measuring investment
performance in common stocks. However, I do say that all investment managements (including self-
management) should be subjected to objective tests, and that the standards should be selected a priori rather than
conveniently chosen retrospectively.

The management of money is big business. Investment managers place great stress on evaluating company
managements in the auto industry, steel industry, chemical industry, etc. These evaluations take enormous
amounts of work, are usually delivered with great solemnity, and are devoted to finding out which companies
are well managed and which companies have management weaknesses. After devoting strenuous efforts to
objectively measuring the managements of portfolio companies, it seems strange indeed that similar
examination is not applied to the portfolio managers themselves. We feel it is essential that investors and
investment managements establish standards of performance and, regularly and objectively, study their own
results just as carefully as they study their investments.

We will regularly follow this policy wherever it may lead. It is perhaps too obvious to say that our policy of
measuring performance in no way guarantees good results--it merely guarantees objective evaluation. I want to
stress the points mentioned in the "Ground Rules" regarding application of the standard--namely that it should
be applied on at least a three-year basis because of the nature of our operation and also that during a speculative
boom we may lag the field. However, one thing I can promise you. We started out with a 36-inch yardstick and
we'll keep it that way. If we don't measure up, we won't change yardsticks. In my opinion, the entire field of
investment management, involving hundreds of billions of dollars, would be more satisfactorily conducted if
everyone had a good yardstick for measurement of ability and sensibly applied it. This is regularly done by most
people in the conduct of their own business when evaluating markets, people, machines, methods, etc., and
money management is the largest business in the world.

Taxes

We entered 1964 with net unrealized gains of $2,991,090 which is all attributable to partners belonging during
1963. Through June 30th we have realized capital gains of $2,826,248.76 (of which 96% are long term) so it
appears very likely that at least all the unrealized appreciation attributable to your interest and reported to you in
our letter of January 25, 1964, (item 3) will be realized this year. I again want to emphasize that this has nothing
to do with how we are doing. It is possible that I could have made the above statement, and the market value of
your B.P.L. interest could have shrunk substantially since January 1st, so the fact that we have large realized
gains is no cause for exultation. Similarly when our realized gains are very small there is not necessarily any
reason to be discouraged. We do not play any games to either accelerate or defer taxes. We make investment
decisions based on our evaluation of the most profitable combination of probabilities. If this means paying taxes
I'm glad the rates on long-term capital gains are as low as they are.

As previously stated in our most recent tax letter of April 1, 1964 the safe course to follow on interim estimates


                                                                                                                   65
is to pay the same estimated tax for 1964 as your actual tax was for 1963. There can be no penalties if you
follow this procedure.

The tax liability for partners who entered January 1st will, of course, be quite moderate, as it always is in the first
year for any partner. This occurs because realized capital gains are first attributed to old partners having an
interest in unrealized appreciation. This, again, of course, has nothing to do with economic performance. All
limited partners, new and old, (except for Bill Scott, Ruth Scott and Susan Buffett per paragraph five of the
Partnership Agreement) end up with exactly the same results. As usual, net ordinary income for all partners is
nominal to date.

As in past years, we will have a letter out about November 1st (to partners and those who have indicated an
interest, to us by that time in becoming partners) with the amendment to the Partnership Agreement,
Commitment Letter for 1965, estimate or the 1964 tax situation, etc. In the meantime, keep Bill busy this
summer clearing up anything in this letter that comes out fuzzy.

Cordially,

Warren E. Buffett

Our Performance in 1964

Although we had an overall gain of $4,846,312.37 in 1964, it was not one of our better years as judged by our
fundamental yardstick, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter called the "Dow"). The overall result for
BPL was plus 27.8% compared to an overall plus 18.7% for the Dow. The overall result for limited partners was
plus 22.3%. Both the advantage of 9.1 percentage points on a partnership basis and 3.6 points by the limited
partners were the poorest since 1959, which was a year of roughly comparable gains for the Dow.

Nevertheless, I am not depressed. It was a strong year for the general market, and it is always tougher for us to
outshine the Dow in such a year. We are certain to have years when the Dow gives us a drubbing and, in some
respects, I feel rather fortunate that 1964 wasn't the year. Because of the problems that galloping markets pose
for us, a Dow repeat in 1965 of 1964 results would make it most difficult for us to match its performance, let
alone surpass it by a decent margin.

To bring the record up to date, the following summarizes the year-by-year performance of the Dow, the
performance of the Partnership before allocation to the general partner, and the limited partner's results:

Investment Companies

We regularly compare our results with the two largest open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that
follow a policy of being typically 95-100% invested in common stock, and the two largest diversified closed-
end investment companies. These four companies, Massachusetts Investors Trust, Investors Stock Fund, Tri-
Continental Corporation, and Lehman Corporation, manage about $4.5 billion, are owned by about 550,000
shareholders, and are probably typical of most of the $30 billion investment company industry. My opinion is
that their results roughly parallel those of the overwhelming majority of other investment advisory organizations
which handle, in aggregate, vastly greater sums.

The purpose of this tabulation, which is shown below, is to illustrate that the Dow is no pushover as an index of
investment achievement. The advisory talent managing just the four companies shown commands annual fees of
over $8 million and this represents a very small fraction of the professional investment management industry.
The public batting average of this highly-paid and widely respected talent indicates performance a shade below
that of the Dow, an unmanaged index.

The repetition of these tables has caused partners to ask: "Why in the world does this happen to very intelligent
managements working with (1) bright, energetic staff people, (2) virtually unlimited resources, (3) the most
extensive business contacts, and (4) literally centuries of aggregate investment experience?" (The latter
qualification brings to mind the fellow who applied for a job and stated he had twenty years of experience -
which was corrected by the former employer to read “one year's experience -twenty times.”)

This question is of enormous importance, and you would expect it to be the subject of considerable study by
investment managers and substantial investors. After all, each percentage point on $30 billion is $300 million
per year. Curiously enough, there is practically nothing in the literature of Wall Street attracting this problem,
and discussion of it is virtually absent at security analyst society meetings, conventions, seminars, etc. My
opinion is that the first job of any investment management organization is to analyze its own techniques and
results before pronouncing judgment on the managerial abilities and performance of the major corporate entities
of the United States.

In the great majority of cases the lack of performance exceeding or even matching an unmanaged index in no
way reflects lack of either intellectual capacity or integrity. I think it is much more the product of: (1) group
decisions - my perhaps jaundiced view is that it is close to impossible for outstanding investment management
to come from a group of any size with all parties really participating in decisions; (2) a desire to conform to the
policies and (to an extent) the portfolios of other large well-regarded organizations; (3) an institutional
framework whereby average is "safe" and the personal rewards for independent action are in no way
commensurate with the general risk attached to such action; (4) an adherence to certain diversification practices
which are irrational; and finally and importantly, (5) inertia.

Perhaps the above comments are unjust. Perhaps even our statistical comparisons are unjust. Both our portfolio
and method of operation differ substantially from the investment companies in the table. However, I believe
both our partners and their stockholders feel their managements are seeking the same goal - the maximum long-
term average return on capital obtainable with the minimum risk of permanent loss consistent with a program of
continuous investment in equities. Since we should have common goals, and most partners, as an alternative to
their interest in BPL, would probably have their funds invested in media producing results comparable with
these investment companies, I feel their performance record is meaningful in judging our own results.

There is no question that an important service is provided to investors by investment companies, investment
advisors, trust departments, etc. This service revolves around the attainment of adequate diversification, the
preservation of a long-term outlook, the ease of handling investment decisions and mechanics, and most
importantly, the avoidance of the patently inferior investment techniques which seem to entice some individuals.
All but a few of the organizations do not specifically promise to deliver superior investment performance
although it is perhaps not unreasonable for the public to draw such an inference from their advertised emphasis
on professional management.

One thing I pledge to you as partners - just as I consider the previously stated performance comparison to be
meaningful now, so will I in future years, no, matter what tale unfolds. Correspondingly, I ask that you, if you
do not feel such a standard to be relevant, register such disagreement now and suggest other standards which can
be applied prospectively rather than retrospectively.


                                                                                                                 69
One additional thought - I have not included a column in my table for the most widely-used investment advisor
in the world - Bell management. People who watch their weight, golf scores, and fuel bills seem to shun
quantitative evaluation of their investment management skills although it involves the most important client in
the world - themselves. While it may be of academic interest to evaluate the management accomplishments of
Massachusetts Investors Trust or Lehman Corporation, it is of enormous dollars-and-cents importance to
evaluate objectively the accomplishments of the fellow who is actually handling your money - even if it’s you.

The Question of Conservatism

In looking at the table of investment company performance, the question might be asked: “Yes, but aren't those
companies run more conservatively than the Partnership?" If you asked that question of the investment company
managements, they, in absolute honesty, would say they were more conservative. If you asked the first hundred
security analysts you met, I am sure that a very large majority of them also would answer for the investment
companies. I would disagree. I have over 90% of my net worth in BPL, and most of my family have percentages
in that area, but of course, that only demonstrates the sincerity of my view - not the validity of it.

It is unquestionably true that the investment companies have their money more conventionally invested than we
do. To many people conventionality is indistinguishable from conservatism. In my view, this represents
erroneous thinking. Neither a conventional nor an unconventional approach, per se, is conservative.

Truly conservative actions arise from intelligent hypotheses, correct facts and sound reasoning. These qualities
may lead to conventional acts, but there have been many times when they have led to unorthodoxy. In some
corner of the world they are probably still holding regular meetings of the Flat Earth Society.

We derive no comfort because important people, vocal people, or great numbers of people agree with us. Nor do
we derive comfort if they don't. A public opinion poll is no substitute for thought. When we really sit back with
a smile on our face is when we run into a situation we can understand, where the facts are ascertainable and
clear, and the course of action obvious. In that case - whether other conventional or unconventional - whether
others agree or disagree - we feel - we are progressing in a conservative manner.

The above may seem highly subjective. It is. You should prefer an objective approach to the question. I do. My
suggestion as to one rational way to evaluate the conservativeness of past policies is to study performance in
declining markets. We have only three years of declining markets in our table and unfortunately (for purposes of
this test only) they were all moderate declines. In all three of these years we achieved appreciably better
investment results than any of the more conventional portfolios.

Specifically, if those three years had occurred in sequence, the cumulative results would have been:

Tri-Continental Corp.                                     -9.7%
Dow                                                       -20.6%
Mass. Investors Trust                                     -20.9%
Lehman Corp.                                              -22.3%
Investors Stock Fund                                      -24.6%
Limited Partners                                          +45.0%

We don’t think this comparison is all important, but we do think it has some relevance. We certainly think it
makes more sense than saying “We own (regardless of price) A.T. &T., General Electric, IBM and General
Motors and are therefore conservative.” In any event, evaluation of the conservatism of any investment program
or management (including self-management) should be based upon rational objective standards, and I suggest
performance in declining markets to be at least one meaningful test.


                                                                                                               70
The Joys of Compounding

Readers of our early annual letters registered discontent at a mere recital of contemporary investment
experience, but instead hungered for the intellectual stimulation that only could be provided by a depth study of
investment strategy spanning the centuries. Hence, this section.

Our last two excursions into the mythology of financial expertise have revealed that purportedly shrewd
investments by Isabella (backing the voyage of Columbus) and Francis I (original purchase of Mona Lisa)
bordered on fiscal lunacy. Apologists for these parties have presented an array of sentimental trivia. Through it
all, our compounding tables have not been dented by attack.

Nevertheless, one criticism has stung a bit. The charge has been made that this column has acquired a negative
tone with only the financial incompetents of history receiving comment. We have been challenged to record on
these pages a story of financial perspicacity which will be a bench mark of brilliance down through the ages.

One story stands out. This, of course, is the saga of trading acumen etched into history by the Manhattan Indians
when they unloaded their island to that notorious spendthrift, Peter Minuit in 1626. My understanding is that
they received $24 net. For this, Minuit received 22.3 square miles which works out to about 621,688,320 square
feet. While on the basis of comparable sales, it is difficult to arrive at a precise appraisal, a $20 per square foot
estimate seems reasonable giving a current land value for the island of $12,433,766,400 ($12 1/2 billion). To the
novice, perhaps this sounds like a decent deal. However, the Indians have only had to achieve a 6 1/2% return
(The tribal mutual fund representative would have promised them this.) to obtain the last laugh on Minuit. At 6
1/2%, $24 becomes $42,105,772,800 ($42 billion) in 338 years, and if they just managed to squeeze out an extra
half point to get to 7%, the present value becomes $205 billion.

So much for that.

Some of you may view your investment policies on a shorter term basis. For your convenience, we include our
usual table indicating the gains from compounding $100,000 at various rates:

                              4%                     8%                    12%                    16%
10 Years                        $48,024               $115,892               $210,584               $341,143
20 Years                       $119,111               $366,094               $864,627              $1,846,060
30 Years                       $224,337               $906,260              $2,895,970             $8,484,940

This table indicates the financial advantages of:

    (1) A long life (in the erudite vocabulary of the financial sophisticate this is referred to as the Methusalah
        Technique)

    (2) A high compound rate

    (3) A combination of both (especially recommended by this author)

To be observed are the enormous benefits produced by relatively small gains in the annual earnings rate. This
explains our attitude which while hopeful of achieving a striking margin of superiority over average investment
results, nevertheless, regards every percentage point of investment return above average as having real meaning.

Our Goal



                                                                                                                     71
You will note that there are no columns in the preceding table for the 27.7% average of the Partnership during
its eight-year lifespan or the 22.3% average of the limited partners. Such figures are nonsensical for the long
term for several reasons: (Don't worry about me "holding back" to substantiate this prophecy.)

    (1) Any significant sums compounded at such rates take on national debt proportions at alarming speed.

    (2) During our eight-year history a general revaluation of securities has produced average annual rates of
        overall gain from the whole common stock field which I believe unattainable in future decades. Over a
        span of 20 or 30 years, I would expect something more like 6% - 7% overall annual gain from the Dow
        instead of the 11.1% during our brief history. This factor alone would tend to knock 4 points or so off of
        our annual compounding rate. It would only take a minus 20.5% year in 1965 for the Dow to bring it
        down to a 7% average figure for the nine years. Such years (or worse) should definitely be expected
        from time to time by those holding equity investments. If a 20% or 30% drop in the market value of
        your equity holdings (such as BPL) is going to produce emotional or financial distress, you should
        simply avoid common stock type investments. In the words of the poet - Harry Truman – “If you can’t
        stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. It is preferable, of course, to consider the problem before you
        enter the “kitchen.”

    (3) We do not consider it possible on an extended basis to maintain the 16.6 percentage point advantage
        over the Dow of the Partnership or the 11.2 percentage point edge enjoyed by the limited partners. We
        have had eight consecutive years in which our pool of money has out-performed the Dow, although the
        profit allocation arrangement left the limited partners short of Dow results in one of those years. We are
        certain to have years (note the plural) when the Partnership results fall short of the Dow despite
        considerable gnashing of teeth by the general partner (I hope not too much by the limited partners).
        When that happens our average margin of superiority will drop sharply. I might say that I also think we
        will continue to have some years of very decent margins in our favor. However, to date we have
        benefited by the fact that we have not had a really mediocre (or worse) year included in our average, and
        this obviously cannot be expected to be a permanent experience.

So what can we expect to achieve? Of course, anything I might say is largely guesswork, and my own
investment philosophy has developed around the theory that prophecy reveals far more of the frailties of the
prophet than it reveals of the future.

Nevertheless, you, as partners, are entitled to know my expectations, tenuous as they may be. I am hopeful that
our longer term experience will unfold along the following basis:

    (1) An overall gain from the Dow (including dividends, of course) averaging in the area of 7% per annum,
        exhibiting customarily wide amplitudes in achieving this average -- say, on the order or minus 40% to
        plus 50% at the extremes with the majority of years in the minus 10% to plus 20% range;

    (2) An average advantage of ten percentage points per annum for BPL before allocation to the general
        partner - again with large amplitudes in the margin from perhaps 10 percentage points worse than the
        Dow in a bad year to 25 percentage points better when everything clicks; and

    (3) The product of these two assumptions gives an average of 17% to BPL or about 14% to limited partners.
        This figure would vary enormously from year to year; the final amplitudes, of course, depending, on the
        interplay of the extremes hypothesized in (1) and (2).

I would like to emphasize that the above is conjecture, perhaps heavily influenced by self-interest, ego, etc.
Anyone with a sense of financial history knows this sort of guesswork is subject to enormous error. It might
better be left out of this letter, but it is a question frequently and legitimately asked by partners. Long-range


                                                                                                                    72
expectable return is the primary consideration of all of us belonging to BPL, and it is reasonable that I should be
put on record, foolish as that may later make me appear. My rather puritanical view is that any investment
manager, whether operating as broker, investment counselor, trust department, Investment Company, etc.,
should be willing to state unequivocally what he is going to attempt to accomplish and how he proposes to
measure the extent to which he gets the job done.

Our Method of Operation

In past annual letters I have always utilized three categories to describe investment operations we conduct. I now
feel that a four-category division is more appropriate. Partially, the addition of a new section - "Generals
Relatively Undervalued" - reflects my further consideration of essential differences that have always existed to a
small extent with our "Generals" group. Partially, it reflects the growing importance of what once was a very
small sub-category but is now a much more significant part of our total portfolio. This increasing importance has
been accompanied by excellent results to date justifying significant time and effort devoted to finding additional
opportunities in this area. Finally, it partially reflects the development and implementation of a new and
somewhat unique investment technique designed to improve the expectancy and consistency of operations in
this category. Therefore, our four present categories are:

1. “Generals -Private Owner Basis” - a category of generally undervalued stocks, determined by quantitative
standards, but with considerable attention also paid to the qualitative factor. There is often little or nothing to
indicate immediate market improvement. The issues lack glamour or market sponsorship. Their main
qualification is a bargain price; that is, an overall valuation of the enterprise substantially below what careful
analysis indicates its value to a private owner to be. Again, let me emphasize that while the quantitative comes
first and is essential, the qualitative is important. We like good management - we like a decent industry - we like
a certain amount of “ferment” in a previously dormant management or stockholder group. But, we demand
value.

Many times in this category we have the desirable "two strings to our bow" situation where we should either
achieve appreciation of market prices from external factors or from the acquisition of a controlling position in a
business at a bargain price. While the former happens in the overwhelming majority of cases, the latter
represents an insurance policy most investment operations don't have. We have continued to enlarge the
positions in the three companies described in our 1964 midyear report where we are the largest stockholder. All
three companies are increasing their fundamental value at a very satisfactory rate, and we are completely passive
in two situations and active only on a very minor scale in the third. It is unlikely that we will ever take a really
active part in policy-making in any of these three companies, but we stand ready if needed.

2. "Generals -Relatively Undervalued" - this category consists of securities selling at prices relatively cheap
compared to securities of the same general quality. We demand substantial discrepancies from current valuation
standards, but (usually because of large size) do not feel value to a private owner to be a meaningful concept. It
is important in this category, of course, that apples be compared to apples - and not to oranges, and we work
hard at achieving that end. In the great majority of cases we simply do not know enough about the industry or
company to come to sensible judgments -in that situation we pass.

As mentioned earlier, this new category has been growing and has produced very satisfactory results. We have
recently begun to implement a technique, which gives promise of very substantially reducing the risk from an
overall change in valuation standards; e.g. I we buy something at 12 times earnings when comparable or poorer
quality companies sell at 20 times earnings, but then a major revaluation takes place so the latter only sell at 10
times.
This risk has always bothered us enormously because of the helpless position in which we could be left
compared to the "Generals -Private Owner" or "Workouts" types. With this risk diminished, we think this
category has a promising future.


                                                                                                                  73
3. "Workouts" - these are the securities with a timetable. They arise from corporate activity - sell-outs, mergers,
reorganizations, spin-offs, etc. In this category we are not talking about rumors or "inside information"
pertaining to such developments, but to publicly announced activities of this sort. We wait until we can read it in
the paper. The risk pertains not primarily to general market behavior (although that is sometimes tied in to a
degree), but instead to something upsetting the applecart so that the expected development does not materialize.
Such killjoys could include anti-trust or other negative government action, stockholder disapproval, withholding
of tax rulings, etc. The gross profits in many workouts appear quite small. It's a little like looking for parking
meters with some time left on them. However, the predictability coupled with a short holding period produces
quite decent average annual rates of return after allowance for the occasional substantial loss. This category
produces more steady absolute profits from year to year than generals do. In years of market decline it should
usually pile up a big edge for us; during bull markets it will probably be a drag on performance. On a long-term
basis, I expect the workouts to achieve the same sort of margin over the Dow attained by generals.

4. "Controls" - these are rarities, but when they occur they are likely to be of significant size. Unless we start off
with the purchase of a sizable block of stock, controls develop from the general - private owner category. They
result from situations where a cheap security does nothing pricewise for such an extended period of time that we
are able to buy a significant percentage of the company's stock. At that point we are probably in a position to
assume a degree of or perhaps complete control of the company's activities. Whether we become active or
remain relatively passive at this point depends upon our assessment of the company's future and the
managements capabilities.

We do not want to get active merely for the sake of being active. Everything else being equal, I would much
rather let others do the work. However, when an active role is necessary to optimize the employment of capital,
you can be sure we will not be standing in the wings.

Active or passive, in a control situation there should be a built-in profit. The sine qua non of this operation is an
attractive purchase price. Once control is achieved, the value of our investment is determined by the value of the
enterprise, not the oftentimes irrationalities of the market place.

Any of the three situations where we are now the largest stockholders mentioned under Generals - Private
Owner could, by virtue of the two-way stretch they possess, turn into controls. That would suit us fine, but it
also suits us if they advance in the market to a price more in line with intrinsic value enabling us to sell them,
thereby completing a successful generals - private owner operation.

Investment results in the control category have to be measured on the basis of at least several years. Proper
buying takes time. If needed, strengthening management, redirecting the utilization of capital, perhaps effecting
a satisfactory sale or merger, etc., are also all factors that make this a business to be measured in years rather
than months. For this reason, in controls, we are looking for wide margins of profit -if it appears at all close, we
quitclaim.

Controls in the buying stage move largely in sympathy with the Dow. In the later stages their behavior is geared
more to that of workouts.

You might be interested to know that the buyers of our former control situation, Dempster Mill Manufacturing,
seem to be doing very well with it. This fulfills our expectation and is a source of satisfaction. An investment
operation that depends on the ultimate buyer making a bum deal (in Wall Street they call this the "Bigger Fool
Theory") is tenuous indeed. How much more satisfactory it is to buy at really bargain prices so that only an
average disposition brings pleasant results.

As I have mentioned in the past, the division of our portfolio among categories is largely determined by the


                                                                                                                     74
accident of availability. Therefore, in any given year the mix between generals, workouts, or controls is largely a
matter of chance, and this fickle factor will have a great deal to do with our performance relative to the Dow.
This is one of many reasons why single year's performance is of minor importance and good or bad, should
never be taken too seriously.

To give an example of just how important the accident of division between these categories is, let me cite the
example of the past three years. Using an entirely different method of calculation than that used to measure the
performance of BPL in entirety, whereby the average monthly investment at market value by category is
utilized, borrowed money and office operating expenses excluded, etc., (this gives the most accurate basis for
intergroup comparisons but does not reflect overall BPL results) the generals (both present categories
combined), workouts, and the Dow, shape up as follows:

         Year                      Generals                    Workouts                       Dow
         1962                       -1.0%                       14.6%                        -8.6%
         1963                       20.5%                       30.6%                        18.4%
         1964                       27.8%                       10.3%                        16.7%

Obviously the workouts (along with controls) saved the day in 1962, and if we had been light in this category
that year, our final result would have been much poorer, although still quite respectable considering market
conditions during the year. We could just as well have had a much smaller percentage of our portfolio in
workouts that year; availability decided it, not any notion on my part as to what the market was going to do.
Therefore, it is important to realize that in 1962 we were just plain lucky regarding mix of categories.

In 1963 we had one sensational workout which greatly influenced results, and generals gave a good account of
themselves, resulting in a banner year. If workouts had been normal, (say, more like 1962) we would have
looked much poorer compared to the Dow. Here it wasn't our mix that did much for us, but rather excellent
situations.

Finally, in 1964 workouts were a big drag on performance. This would be normal in any event during a big plus
year for the Dow such as 1964, but they were even a greater drag than expected because of mediocre experience.
In retrospect it would have been pleasant to have been entirely in generals, but we don’t play the game in
retrospect.

I hope the preceding table drives home the point that results in a given year are subject to many variables - some
regarding which we have little control or insight. We consider all categories to be good businesses and we are
very happy we have several to rely on rather than just one. It makes for more discrimination within each
category and reduces the chance we will be put completely out of operation by the elimination of opportunities
in a single category.

Taxes

We have had a chorus of groans this year regarding partners' tax liabilities. Of course, we also might have had a
few if the tax sheet had gone out blank.

More investment sins are probably committed by otherwise quite intelligent people because of "tax
considerations" than from any other cause. One of my friends - a noted West Coast philosopher maintains that a
majority of life's errors are caused by forgetting what one is really trying to do. This is certainly the case when
an emotionally supercharged element like taxes enters the picture (I have another friend -a noted East Coast
philosopher who says it isn't the lack of representation he minds -it's the taxation).

Let's get back to the West Coast. What is one really trying to do in the investment world? Not pay the least


                                                                                                                 75
taxes, although that may be a factor to be considered in achieving the end. Means and end should not be
confused, however, and the end is to come away with the largest after-tax rate of compound. Quite obviously if
two courses of action promise equal rates of pre-tax compound and one involves incurring taxes and the other
doesn't the latter course is superior. However, we find this is rarely the case.

It is extremely improbable that 20 stocks selected from, say, 3000 choices are going to prove to be the optimum
portfolio both now and a year from now at the entirely different prices (both for the selections and the
alternatives) prevailing at that later date. If our objective is to produce the maximum after-tax compound rate,
we simply have to own the most attractive securities obtainable at current prices, And, with 3,000 rather rapidly
shifting variables, this must mean change (hopefully “tax-generating” change).

It is obvious that the performance of a stock last year or last month is no reason, per se, to either own it or to not
own it now. It is obvious that an inability to "get even" in a security that has declined is of no importance. It is
obvious that the inner warm glow that results from having held a winner last year is of no importance in making
a decision as to whether it belongs in an optimum portfolio this year.

If gains are involved, changing portfolios involves paying taxes. Except in very unusual cases (I will readily
admit there are some cases), the amount of the tax is of minor importance if the difference in expectable
performance is significant. I have never been able to understand why the tax comes as such a body blow to
many people since the rate on long-term capital gain is lower than on most lines of endeavor (tax policy
indicates digging ditches is regarded as socially less desirable than shuffling stock certificates).

I have a large percentage of pragmatists in the audience so I had better get off that idealistic kick. There are only
three ways to avoid ultimately paying the tax: (1) die with the asset - and that's a little too ultimate for me even
the zealots would have to view this "cure" with mixed emotions; (2) give the asset away - you certainly don't
pay any taxes this way, but of course you don't pay for any groceries, rent, etc., either; and (3) lose back the gain
if your mouth waters at this tax-saver, I have to admire you -you certainly have the courage of your convictions.

So it is going to continue to be the policy of BPL to try to maximize investment gains, not minimize taxes. We
will do our level best to create the maximum revenue for the Treasury -at the lowest rates the rules will allow.

An interesting sidelight on this whole business of taxes, vis-à-vis investment management, has appeared in the
last few years. This has arisen through the creation of so-called "swap funds" which are investment companies
created by the exchange of the investment company's shares for general market securities held by potential
investors. The dominant sales argument has been the deferment (deferment, when pronounced by an enthusiastic
salesman, sometimes comes very close phonetically to elimination) of capital gains taxes while trading a single
security for a diversified portfolio. The tax will only finally be paid when the swap fund's shares are redeemed.
For the lucky ones, it will be avoided entirely when any of those delightful alternatives mentioned two
paragraphs earlier eventuates.

The reasoning implicit in the swapee's action is rather interesting. He obviously doesn't really want to hold what
he is holding or he wouldn't jump at the chance to swap it (and pay a fairly healthy commission - usually up to
$100,000) for a grab-bag of similar hot potatoes held by other tax-numbed investors. In all fairness, I should
point out that after all offerees have submitted their securities for exchange and had a chance to review the
proposed portfolio they have a chance to back out but I understand a relatively small proportion do so.

There have been twelve such funds (that I know of) established since origination of the idea in 1960, and several
more are currently in the works. The idea is not without appeal since sales totaled well over $600 million. All of
the funds retain an investment manager to whom they usually pay 1/2 of 1% of asset value. This investment
manager faces an interesting problem; he is paid to manage the fund intelligently (in each of the five largest
funds this fee currently ranges from $250,000 to $700,000 per year), but because of the low tax basis inherited


                                                                                                                    76
from the contributors of securities, virtually his every move creates capital gains tax liabilities. And, of course,
he knows that if he incurs such liabilities, he is doing so for people who are probably quite sensitive to taxes or
they wouldn't own shares in the swap fund in the first place.

I am putting all of this a bit strongly, and I am sure there are some cases where a swap fund may be the best
answer to an individual's combined tax and investment problems. Nevertheless, I feel they offer a very
interesting test-tube to measure the ability of some of the most respected investment advisors when they are
trying to manage money without paying (significant) taxes.

The three largest swap funds were all organized in 1961, and combined have assets now of about $300 million.
One of these, Diversification Fund, reports on a fiscal year basis which makes extraction of relevant data quite
difficult for calendar year comparisons. The other two, Federal Street Fund and Westminster Fund (respectively
first and third largest in the group) are managed by investment advisors who oversee at least $2 billion of
institutional money.

Here's how they shape up for all full years of existence:

        Year                     Federal Street               Westminster                       Dow
        1962                        -19.0%                      -22.5%                         -7.6%
        1963                         17.0%                       18.7%                         20.6%
        1964                         13.8%                       12.3%                         18.7%
 Annual Compounded                   2.6%                        1.1%                           9.8%
        Rate

This is strictly the management record. No allowance has been made for the commission in entering and any
taxes paid by the fund on behalf of the shareholders have been added back to performance.

Anyone for taxes?

Miscellaneous

In the December 21st issue of AUTOMOTIVE NEWS it was reported that Ford Motor Co. plans to spend $700
million in 1965 to add 6,742,000 square feet to its facilities throughout the world. Buffett Partnership, Ltd.,
never far behind, plans to add 227 1/4 square feet to its facilities in the spring of 1965.

Our growth in net assets from $105,100 (there's no prize for guessing who put in the $100) on May 5, 1956
when the first predecessor limited partnership.(Buffett Associates, Ltd. ) was organized, to $26,074,000 on
1/1/65 creates the need for an occasional reorganization in internal routine. Therefore, roughly
contemporaneously with the bold move from 682 to 909 ¼ square feet, a highly capable is going to join our
organization with responsibility for the administrative (and certain other) functions. This move will particularly
serve to free up more of Bill Scott's time for security analysis which is his forte. I’ll have more to report on this
in the midyear letter.

Bill (who continues to do a terrific job) and his wife have an investment in the Partnership of $298,749, a very
large majority of their net worth. Our new associate (his name is being withheld until his present employer has
replaced him), along with his wife and children, has made an important investment in the Partnership. Susie and
I presently have an interest of $3,406,700 in BPL which represents virtually our entire net worth, with the
exception of our continued holding of Mid-Continent Tab Card Co., a local company into which I bought in
1960 when it had less than 10 stockholders. Additionally, my relatives, consisting of three children, mother , two
sisters, two brothers-in-law, father-in-Law, four aunts, four cousins and six nieces and nephews, have interests
in BPL, directly or indirectly, totaling $1,942,592. So we all continue to eat home cooking.


                                                                                                                   77
We continue to represent the ultimate in seasonal businesses --open one day a year. This creates real problems in
keeping the paper flowing smoothly, but Beth and Donna continue to do an outstanding job of coping with this
and other problems.

Peat, Marwick, Mitchell has distinguished itself in its usual vital role of finding out what belongs to whom. We
continue to throw impossible deadlines at them --and they continue to perform magnificently. You will note in
their certificate this year that they have implemented the new procedure whereby they now pounce on us
unannounced twice a year in addition to the regular yearend effort.

Finally -and most sincerely -let me thank you partners who cooperate magnificently in getting things to us
promptly and properly and thereby maximize the time we can spend working where we should be -by the cash
register. I am extremely fortunate in being able to spend the great majority of my time thinking about where our
money should be invested, rather than getting bogged down in the minutiae that seems to overwhelm so many
business entities. We have an organizational structure which makes this efficiency a possibility, and more
importantly, we have a group of partners that make it a reality. For this, I am most appreciative and we are all
wealthier.

Our past policy has been to admit close relatives of present partners without a minimum capital limitation. This
year a flood of children, grandchildren, etc., appeared which called this policy into question; therefore, I have
decided to institute a $25,000 minimum on interests of immediate relatives of present partners.

Within the coming two weeks you will receive:

    (1) A tax letter giving you all BPL information needed for your 1964 federal income tax return. This letter
        is the only item that counts for tax purposes.

    (2) An audit from Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. for 1964, setting forth the operations and financial
        position of BPL as well as your own capital account.

    (3) A letter signed by me setting forth the status of your BPL interest on 111165. This is identical with the
        figure developed in the audit.

    (4) Schedule “A” to the partnership agreement listing all partners.

Let Bill or me know if anything needs clarifying. Even with our splendid staff our growth means there is more
chance of missing letters, overlooked instructions, a name skipped over, a figure transposition, etc., so speak up
if you have any question at all that we might have erred. My next letter will be about July 15th" summarizing
the first half of this year.

Cordially,

Warren E. Buffett

First Half Performance:

During the first half of 1965, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (hereinafter call the “Dow”) declined from
874.13 to 868.03. This minor change was accomplished in a decidedly non-Euclidian manner. The Dow instead
took the scenic route, reaching a high of 939.62 on May 14th. Adding back dividends on the Dow of 13.49 gives
an overall gain through ownership of the Dow for the first half of 7.39 or 0.8%.

We had one of our better periods with an overall gain, before allocation to the general partner, of 10.4% or a 9.6
percentage point advantage over the Dow. To bring the record up to date, the following summarizes the year-by-
year performance of the Dow, the performance of the Partnership before allocation to the general partner, and
the limited partners’ results:

Our constant admonitions have been: (1) that short-term results (less than three years) have little meaning,
particularly in reference to an investment operation such as ours that may devote a portion of resources to
control situations; and, (2) that our results, relative to the Dow and other common-stock-form media usually will
be better in declining markets and may well have a difficult time just matching such media in very strong


                                                                                                                    79
markets.

With the latter point in mind, it might be imagined that we struggled during the first four months of the half to
stay even with the Dow and then opened up our margin as it declined in May and June. Just the opposite
occurred. We actually achieved a wide margin during the upswing and then fell at a rate fully equal to the Dow
during the market decline.

I don’t mention this because I am proud of such performance – on the contrary, I would prefer it if we had
achieved our gain in the hypothesized manner. Rather, I mention it for two reasons: (1) you are always entitled
to know when I am wrong as well as right; and, (2) it demonstrates that although we deal with probabilities and
expectations, the actual results can deviate substantially from such expectations, particularly on a short-term
basis. As mentioned in the most recent annual letter, our long-term goal is to achieve a ten percentage point per
annum advantage over the Dow. Our advantage of 9.6 points achieved during the first six months must be
regarded as substantially above average. The fortitude demonstrated by our partners in tolerating such favorable
variations is commendable. We shall most certainly encounter periods when the variations are in the other
direction.

During the first half, a series of purchases resulted in the acquisition of a controlling interest in one of the
situations described in the “General Private Owner” section of the last annual letter. When such a controlling
interest is acquired, the assets and earning power of the business become the immediate predominant factors in
value. When a small minority interest in a company is held, earning power and assets are, of course, very
important, but they represent an indirect influence on value which, in the short run, may or may not dominate
the factors bearing on supply and demand which result in price.

When a controlling interest is held, we own a business rather then a stock, and a business valuation is
appropriate. We have carried our controlling position at a conservative valuation at midyear and will reevaluate
it in terms of assets and earning power at yearend. The annual letter, issued in January,
